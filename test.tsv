pos	Telefèric totally did an outstanding job last night. The tapas are a must-try here. The enriched flavors and outstanding presentations amazed the party. All the seafood and ingredients are incredibly fresh. The aroma of lobsters and shrimps was so well baked into the paella rice. And don’t miss out on desserts. Guaranteed to wrap up your night with surprises.
pos	Me and my two roommates went to try this place out on a packed Thursday night. Little did we know that we needed a reservation to secure a table. Luckily, the chefs counter was full service so we got seated right away.  First impression was the vibe. It was so energetic and everyone was smiling and laughing. The service was insanely prompt and you never had to ask for any water refills or for them to clear your table of finished plates. The timing of the appetizers and main course was on a other level. We never stopped eating and the portions are perfect for 1-3 people. The pictures attached to this reviews do not give it justice as you HAVE to come and try ANYTHING on their menu and you are guaranteed to have a wonderful time.  Overall, this has been the best experience food wise I've had in the bay area. This will be hard to remove from my top 3 restaurants. Come and give it a try and make sure to order one of their signature cocktails/sangria! You won't regret any of it
pos	This Spanish tapas is colorful and lively. Great cozy seating, with friendly staff and eclectic music. The music is a little loud so expect to speak up! They have a tasty cocktail menu and the small plates are delicious. I was dining with clients so my photos are limited but I was able to grab a photo of the Paella lobster which was divine!  Ordered the grilled octopus, ham croquettes, empanadas, cheese board and Paella Lobster. I will definitely be back for more of this tapas goodness!
pos	We had a delicious dinner of tapas and gin & tonics.  Our favorites were the tuna tacos, with a flavorful avocado filling with just the right amount of kick, and the shrimp cooked in a black garlic infused oil.  Very tasty.  The Ibiza gin & tonic was festive and not too sweet or strong.  Next visit we’ll try the paellas!
pos	What an absolutely brilliant find. The food is amazing and the service is up there with the best restaurants in the Bay Area. The authentic paella took us right back to our time in Barcelona in 2019.  We’ll definitely be visiting again!
pos	I love the squids 🦑 rice and my husband love the pork one a lots. Last time I came here was a much better experience but this time I was a little bit disappointed. We finished everything and want to sit down to talk, but unfortunately the server wanted us to leave ASAP so when he picked up the table, he just took away all the water cup as well. I hope this can get improved but I will definitely come back to give another try
pos	Good tapas, but not recommended for paella.  But I give it 5 stars because the tapas and Shangri-La were so fantastic.  If I lived nearby, I would have considered a return visit and would try the tapas set with a menu other than paella.  Forcing a separate $20 tip is too "BARBARIC".
pos	I just had my 60th birthday party here.  What a fantastic restaurant.  We loved the Tapas, Paella's (get the lobster paella or the Tomahawk steak paella's...they were fantastic).  We all agreed that the tuna tacos were the best for starters.  Absolutely fantastic service and food.  We will definitely go back again
pos	Must try their Paellas and Sangria!  I also very loved octopus lag with potato purée. Their seefood menus are very fresh, soft (melts in your mouth) and flavorful.  I didnt really enjoy Spanish Meat balls - too salty.  I would say it's better to make a reservation in advance. You might need to wait a bit till your server comes to your table😅
pos	Spanish food? Count me in! This restaurant brings the great vibe and taste of Spain to California. Even if you are not a fan of seafood, you are going to fall in love with it in here. The atmosphere was crowded and noisy, but it totally was as energetic as Spanish cafes! Try it for sure if you are around.
pos	two of us had lunch indoor. We had Sangria and Berry Cloudy and hot water as our drink, all good, I like the sangria better. We ordered six tapas, the potato dish tasted not bad, but too ordinary, I felt I can make this at home easily.  The chicken dish Empanadas was a bit too salty if dipped in the sauce.  Other dishes were all delicious, even my husband was happy.
pos	The tapas were good and the portions were great for our party of 3 (we ordered 6 tapas).  Great service and nice ambiance. It was a little challenging to sustain our conversation because there were about 3-4 servers that continuously tried to refill our waters when we didn’t want them refilled: this by no means ruined our meal, it was just distracting.
neg	Leaving a 2 star review because my first experience at this location did not meet my expectations.  Food quality was really good but I didn't think the portion and price matched. Paella-We had the weekend special paella and I was expecting a deep dish. When my wife started to mix the plate the spoon hit the bottom of the pan as soon as she passed a single grain of rice. Very shallow from other paella dishes I've had. We also asked for the bottom to be a bit crispy but that didn't happen. Pulpo- Delicious flavor and the meat was cooked  perfectly, tender inside with a bit of singe Tacos- Fresh tuna with a combo of ingredients. Put together very well. Croquettes- The slice of bacon on top seems to get smaller every year from the pictures I've seen. But it's still worth trying as it was very delicious. Iberian Oyster- Very flavorful and the presentation was unique Salmon Tartare- The sweet chips with seeds went very well with the salmon tartare. Unique flavor to land on your palate Dragon Ball- This was a chorizo covered with a fried corn crust. It sounded good on the menu but the taste was okay. The chorizo tasted salty instead of spicy. Dessert- Had a trio that included french toast, tres leches, and churros. It's probably the worst churro I have ever had, worse than the churros that came back to Costco food court. The churro was stuffed with Nutella and the outside was maybe just overcooked so it tasted a bit stale. Didn't have the classic Barcelona style where you dip it. The Tres Leches would be my pick if you wanted to go with a single dessert. Had the perfect amount of pudding, cream and caramel. Service- Felt very slow. I had to ask the server for a refill of water every time, instead of them doing the normal rounds that they did for the other tables around us. We ended up spending 2 hours throughout dinner from several plates of food which most were bite sized. On top of all this "great" service there is a mandatory 20% gratuity included on your bill. I don't feel that we got a 20% gratuity worth of service. Overall, the food was good but I won't be coming back for another round. I enjoyed my experience much more in Barcelona than this copy of a restaurant.
pos	This place is phenomenal! The vibe is great. I  went for lunch on a Tuesday but they were still pretty busy. A mix of young and older people. I had the Patatas Bravas and The lobster Paella! Both were great. The mistake I made was I got mine for 1 serving but I still paid for almost two ($48). So definitely get the normal portion and if you have extra take it to go.
pos	Best paella I have had in the Bay area. Definitely expensive and while the portions were not filling, the taste was phenomenal. The lobster and octopus were so tender and the rice rich with flavor. Sangrias were refreshing just boozy enough. Worth the money and the atmosphere was light and playful making it a great date spot
pos	We were thirsty not hungry, but we end up having empanadas, crab croquettes, the octopus and the Torrija!!.. everything was great !!. The service, the drinks, the food, the energy, the hostess smiling back at us!!.. Emmanuel, Alex and Alejandro made our evening fun and pleasant.  We will recommend this place to our friends, definitely.
pos	Really good, but you gotta go for the paella or main plates. The tapas are fine, but they're all pretty heavy and can get you feeling real unhealthy after a few plates. Service is a mix, but always adequately staffed.
pos	Never disappointed when I dine here. It’s my favorite lunch place as it’s right outside Stanford campus. I miss the lovely patio that they have during the pandemic. The food is still food though, paella is excellent, try the squid ink one, so is pulpo, salmon tartare and Brussels sprout. Highly recommended!
pos	Best tapas I've ever had! While it did get a bit pricey, we were all very pleased with every dish. The pork belly paella was to die for, all the appetizers we got were stunningly presented as well as tasty, and our drinks were beautiful and delicious.
pos	Teleferic is a great place to take someone on a date or group gathering. Lots of food to try and plenty of interesting cocktails.  Food: Ham Croquetas is definitely very cheesy. The ham is barely noticeable. The spicy sauce is not hot enough. The airline is sweet and milky.  Crab Croquetas is the best item on their menu. It blows everything else out of the water. I would recommend this over any other dishes. The seafood is very faint. I don't like seafood but I do think this dish is tasty.  Pan con tomate was good. The loaf was just right. Very refreshing to snack on. Bruchetta is still better in my opinion.  Empanadas were very overrated. They aren't good as Mexican Empanadas. The flavor is very subtle. I would say there are better dishes on the menu, but if you like Empanadas, then get it.  Taquitos de Tuna were good. It's basically Ceviche but in taco form. Fish was fresh and not fishy. A lot of flavor going for it.  DragonBall were not good. Don't even get it. They need to take it off the menu.  Spanish meatballs were good. It taste like meatball with curry. You only get 4 meatballs for the meal.  Drinks: The Tourist is a tequila drink with lychee, raspberries, honey, and lime. The drink taste slightly tangy. It has a grapefruit kind of taste. The lychee definitely gets overshadowed by the raspberry flavor. Drink is easy to drink.  The Gothic Mojito Passion Fruit is very delicious. Not only is it bubbly but sweet. One of the best mojitos I have drank in awhile. I would recommend this drink.  Ambience: Very loud. The inside is somewhat dark, but there is plenty of lights at each table. There's a bar with a large selection of drinks. The outside has seating as well.  Parking: Shares with all the businesses in the plaza. You will need to come early for parking.  Amenities: Restroom is co-ed. There is a share sink area for all the restroom. No free wifi.
pos	I loved this place so much when I came on Saturday last week that I took my entire team here for an off-site again this week! Every single dish is incredible and the service is outstanding. My favorite had to be the pork dish (plate) and the tuna tacos but honestly you cannot go wrong and now that I've been twice I've tried half the menu 😂  Sangria is delicious and desserts were also tasty. Most all the tapas and other plates can be made gluten and nut free which is the ultimate dream. I cannot wait to come back again soon to try more.
pos	Excellent meal in a relaxed and casual environment - perfect for a spring/summer evening meal!  The Hidden Gem Salad was delicious, and the rice cake covering was a simple yet fun presentation.  Squid tapas could have been a a little crisper and less oily, but had excellent flavor. Looks like it may be a newer menu item.  Gambas al ajilo we’re excellent. We could tell why this is a long standing menu favorite!
pos	Fantastic paella restraunt.The restraunt was clean and covid compliant. The food, service and atmosphere were great and we had a fun time. We will definitely be back.
pos	A cable car named Barcelona? Busy, noisy, upscale. The main thing that sets Telefèric apart from most tapas establishments is presentation and style. Much of the tableware is crafted to showcase and enhance the dish. Presentation is thoughtfully designed to complement the flavours and texture of the mains; sauces, garnish and arrangement. Unlike some other tapas 'bars', the small plates/entrées are not an afterthought. The same attention is paid to their details. Portions are sensible and there is variety and innovation in the paella. The wine and cocktail menus are quite extensive. As I said, it is also frequently very busy, and there may be a short wait, even with a reservation during peak times. A tip is automatically added to the bill.
pos	Our favorite place for Spanish cuisine - been here multiple times. Especially love their paellas, octopus, shrimp dish, and their crab croquettes!
pos	Beautiful and tasty drink! Great service and delicious tapas. However, disappointing paella, while flavor was okay, for the price it was very thin on protein. 2 clams, 3 tiny quids and some rice for $70 is steep. But finished strong with desert assortment that faded away memories of paella.
pos	Best paella I've had, and I'll definitely be returning. We tried a lot of the tapas plates, and our favourites were the brussel sprouts and the crab croquettes.
pos	Nice indoor decorations. Above average food. 20% tips added automatically in the check. About $70 per person.
pos	Definitely a place I will come back to! Don't be like me, call in to reserve a spot beforehand. I was lucky enough to get a table via walk-in but had to sit outside in the cold.  Service: A+, food came out quick and our server kept checking in on us. She gave really good recommendations on food and drinks!  Crab Croquettes 4/5 ($9): this was so good. The only sad part is that it's tiny ;--; the tuna sashimi was umami and sweet, which complimented well with the fried, creamy crab croquette.  Pulpo Telefèric 5/5 ($18): garlic grilled octopus with truffle oil and purée. This was one of the best dishes! Perfectly seasoned and  Paella Negra 4/5 ($44): a paella is like a Spanish rice dish. This specific paella came with squid Ink, scallops, seasonal mushrooms, octopus, gulf shrimp & clams. This was Good! I felt it was a little too salty for me but mixed in with the aioli it was good. Ordered it with the crispy rice bottom. Perfect for 2.  The drinks are really good. I got the Sangria Barceloneta and it was amazing.  TLDR: a great high end date night spot. Just remember to reserve beforehand!
pos	Amazing place! Food presentation is stylish (which is not so common in Bay Area), we ordered about 5-7 dishes, Sangria cocktails and everything was delicious. Our favorite dishes - Pulpo Teleferic, Taquitos de Tuna & Avocado, Salmon Tartar! Other is also nice, but these were full of different tastes! When I went here the first time, I decided to come back with my husband. And here we are, celebrating his birthday!
pos	Delicious options for food and drinks. Great, fast, and attentive service. A little expensive depending on your order. The berry cloudy is a delicious option for drinks and the salon tartar, tuna tacos, and tomato watermelon were awesome options for food. Ask for recommendations on food too!
pos	I highly recommend this place. My friends and I frequent this restaurant, both locations, in Palo Alto and in Walnut Creek. Food is amazing, It is consistently and authentically delicious.  I must say that I have tasted better tapas here than in Spain. Service is great & fast. Every time I have a visitor from out of town, I bring them there, and we all love it.
pos	Mmm yes! Check this off my peninsula bucket list and sign me up for returns! You should definitely make reservations 1-2 weeks ahead unless you like eating very early or very late.  My friends and I met up at 6pm and were seated in a semi-private area outside. We began our meal with several tapas including the Crab Croquettes, Jamón Ibérico de Bellota, Pulpo Telefèric, and Spanish Meatballs. Every last dish was wonderful! For drinks, I went with the Berry Cloudy which was good, but definitely a heavy hitter. Every drink that was ordered was gorgeous and vibrant in color.  The croquettes were small (only 2 in the dish) but they were perfectly crisp on the outside and deliciously creamy on the inside. The tuna sashimi added just a little more pizzazz to the dish. The jamón was a GENEROUS plate. We added tomato bruschetta on the side which really helped balance the rich savory acorny from the ham. The octopus doesn't need a description - trust that it's a must have. Lastly, the Spanish meatballs were super tender. It was a beef based meatball served over a masala sauce with crispy pik-nik style potatoes. The play on textures was fun!  For mains, we went with the lobster paella and a side of brussel sprouts, for health. The lemon vinaigrette on the brussel sprouts was quite tasty and you really can't go wrong with shaved parm, but I thought our sprouts were a little overdone overall. As for the paella, we were asked if we wanted soccarat. If we wanted soccarat? What CRIMES against paella are people committing daily if a Spanish restaurant has to ask this?? While there wasn't a large amount of seafood (small lobster tail, 2 shrimp, and bits of octopus), the paella was definitely a star. It was rich and velvety with just the right bit of crispy on the bottom. If I were to go back, I want to try the Paella Negra next time!  For dessert we went with the Torrija, a play on french toast with ice cream. Loved the contrast in temperatures and textures!  Overall, it's a great (albeit splurgy) meal!
pos	Not too impressed Strong briny and garlicky flavor of the Pella which I do like But portion is really small for its price. Maybe cuz we ordered extra crunchy-yes you could do that- the garlic flavor had a burned taste People out there saying it’s a lot of food for 2 are just insanely tiny people.  Not a fan a the foamy goat cheese sauce on the fried cauliflower. Taste was good but foamy cheese texture? Not a fan.  Special ham croquette? I don’t taste the ham at all. Might be good if you actually taste.
pos	Delicious tapas n paella. Big portions beware on some dishes. Service good. Very Loud when busy. White sauce on many dishes--will ask without  next time. Going back to try the rest of the menu but not easy getting rezzie.
neg	We got the crab paella. Had high expectations but I had to say it was disappointing. It didn't smell fresh and was lacking flavors. The pot was shallow and it costs you $68 for two persons. The vibe wasn't so pleasant either. It was very loud if you sit outside. And they charged 20% mandatory tips.  In contrast, the drink was awesome. Tapas were also good. If you are for paella, this is not the right place. Try Cascal in downtown mountain view.  ========== My rating scale: 5: will definitely come back and always prefer this place when planning 4: will come back for a casual setting 3: generally won't come back when there are other options 2: will never come back and do not recommend it to anyone 1: why does this place even exist?
pos	Excellent food and drinks! Their pulpo and crab croquette were really delicious. All of their paellas were good as well, but my favorite was the seafood paella, very well done. The service was excellent as well.
neg	We were pretty disappointed eating here. The food was ok and not outstanding. This place is pricey for what you get. Very small servings. We received the bill for a table of two and it included an automatic gratuity fee of  20% then they expected a tip on top of that. Most other restaurants only charge the gratuity for tables of 6 or more. The 20% fee was also on top of service fee. Be warned!!!
pos	Went there for an early dinner. Nice trendy place, surprised I had never been there. It is very popular so reserve a table. We requested outdoor seating but were hosted inside - a little annoyed with that but was happy when the drinks arrived :)  I had the Flaca - the first round was a bit too sweet for me. The next one I asked them to hold back on the syrup - tasted awesome. My fellow diner had a couple glasses of Albariño- she thought it was very good.  We ordered potatoes bravas for an appetizer, I ended up having some of that with my entree as well. For dinner I got the ribs - it was decent and avocado and bbq both were good. I’ve had a lot of bbq in Nashville etc, so my bar for bbq is very very high :) but it was barbecued well and the sauce had a bit of zing so made it even better. My fellow diner had the crab paella - she asked them not to include the octopus and they obliged. She liked it.  No room for dessert but since it was one of our birthdays, they gave us complementary dessert - which was nice of them.  Overall a good place to on a Friday or Saturday- good for drinks and food.
pos	Amazing food and stellar service! The sangria was refreshing, and all the tapas we ordered were delish. Would love to dine here again and the next time will try the paella!
pos	We'd ordered, Patatas Bravas, Lobster Paella, Veggie Paella, Empanadas, Pulpo Telefèric, Watermelon Tomatoes and Crab Croquettes.  Drinks: Sangria Telefèric (Amazing), Haunted Soul (Halloween special), Rosemary Lemonade(Amazing as well)  Patatas Bravas was amazing while Watermelon Tomatoes was a unique dish but I'd say it's an acquired taste.  Although their Veg Paella wasn't the best, their appetizers and drinks were on another level.  That being said, the lobster & shrimp paella and other dishes were rated well by my friends who were meat eaters.  Place had an amazing ambience and was very lively and functional. So much so, that on a Tuesday night we had to wait and struggle to get a seat cause they had everything booked out.  Make sure you reserve well ahead as they're one of the few restaurants that book off their entire seating and not just a percentage of available seats.
neu	The food was good,  everything  we ordered were fresh and delicious very close to what you can eat in Spain.   Only thing we didn't  like is Mandatory  20% Tip  automatically  added on your Bill 😒.
pos	Conveniently situated in Palo Alto's Town and Country Village as well as positioned across Stanford University, Teleferic Barcelona is a must try for Spanish cuisine. Their Pulpo or Octopus is absolutely exquisite and the Paella, especially lobster is very delicious!
pos	Overall the food is delicious. Good service. But the outdoor seating is not ideal as some seatings come with no shade
pos	Outstanding Spanish restaurant with attached market. Great tapas. Awesome paella. Try the paella negra... Squid ink paella. Their sangria is also great.
pos	I have been looking for a good Spanish restaurant since I love tapas, a friend recommended this place. No doubt everything is so good, appetizers, entrées, dessert and the variety of sangria. Always make the reservation in advance because it's really busy!
pos	I’ve tried a lot of Spanish restaurants in town, and I have to commit that this is best one! Lots of paella I had before were too salty, but not Teleferic’s. It tasted great! And the portion of each dish is just about right. Their service is also amazing. While we have waited for our paella for about 30 minutes, our waiter told me that the chef did not like the one he cooked for us so he decided to cook a new dish. For apologizing, our waiter offered us one of his favorite dish. One star off was due to the background music. It was so loud that I couldn’t hear my friend…
pos	Busy even on a weekday! Really enjoyed the octopus. The kale corn salad with popcorn and toasted quinoa is an interesting but tasty combo. Got to sit right in front of the kitchen staff their work; incredibly hard and fast working people 🙂
pos	Delicious cocktails good sangria 3 different kinds . Tapas all good paella was missing safran flavor so no good
pos	Ten of us came here for dinner on a Tuesday night.  Parking was not too bad.  We made a reservation so there was no need to wait for a table.  By around 6:30 PM, all tables were occupied.  My wife came here many times for lunch and dinner, but it was my first time.  Since she has been here so many times she ordered a ton of food for everyone to taste.  Mainly tapas, but also salad and rice.  I ate so much but did not know any of the names!  The service was excellent.  Food was delicious.  Price was reasonable.  Ten of us and the bill was $700.  Definitely need to go back again soon!
pos	Mixed paella was really good. Definitely one of the best Ive had so far in the bay area.
pos	Food is awesome. Ordered tapas and paella, very delicious. The cocktail can be better. Price is a bit high but overall is great.
pos	WOW! I have never liked spanish food before this. Amazingly attentive staff and great service.  Must haves: Crab Croquetas, Chicken Empanadas, albóndigas, Grilled octopus, pan con tomate (with sobrasada) . A hidden gem in Palo Alto!  Overall: ✅
neu	I stopped by to pick up some empanadas as a sample of Teleferic Barcelona’s cuisine. The oxtail empanadas were very, very small (two big mouthfuls or four smaller bites). Inside: the minced oxtail was moist and flavorful. The aioli that came with the empanadas was a winner! It was a green cilantro with lime condiment (like mayo) which really added a bright note to the empanadas. The exterior: the oxtail wrapper was thin and flaky phyllo-type pastry. A nice sample but for the price ($14 for two), this dish is way over priced. Unless you don’t concern yourself on the cost, order this if you love an oxtail bite.
pos	Had a great time in the Palo Alto restaurant. I love how spacious the place is even when it is a full house you don't feel that it is too crowded. The bar is extremely comfy and the service is just stellar. Albert, the crew with the girls who are so welcoming and truly so great at making recommendations and going the extra mile to make sure you have a good time. I can't wait to go back!
pos	I ate here with friends in March 2020.  Simply the best Catalan cuisine I’ve had outside of Barcelona, Spain!  Bring several family members or friends so you can order many items and share family style.  You’ll want to return and try everything on the menu.
pos	Super delicious! We didn’t reserve so ended up with the bar seats. They served food very fast.
pos	Excellent tapas, paellas and other fare... it's like a trip to Barcelona!!! Great cocktails and wine too. We focused on tapas...corn and kale salad, meatballs and porca (pork belly).  Everything was authentic and so delicious! Perfectly prepared.  Reservations are a plus as it gets very busy here.
pos	Went to Sunday brunch/lunch with friends and a baby. Parking may be a bit difficult during weekends since many goods restaurants are in this plaza. We were welcome and baby wheelchair was allowed to go in. We had a nice experience with food, drink and their hospitality! We had two great different paellas. Trio dessert was perfect !
neg	Such a disappointment.  It took ten minutes for a server to come by to even say hi after we were seated.  The prawns were over cooked and under seasoned and sat in a large pool of oil. The tomato toast was lacking salt.  The calamari was greasy and over cooked and tough.   The beef kebabs were over cooked.  The Brussels sprouts were burnt and greasy on the outside but raw on the inside.  We many dishes half eaten.  I honestly cannot remember the last time I had such a disappointing dining experience.  It is honestly like they didn’t care about food quality.  The room was buzzing so maybe the patrons don’t care about food quality either then?
pos	Atmosphere was excellent and the food tastes really good, especially the paella.
pos	Cozy Spanish restaurant. The food and service are great. We had Empanadas, Paella, Churros...delicious
pos	Pretty solid Tapas spot, at a pretty Palo Alto price. Good cocktails, though only if you're a sweet tooth. Strong offerings on meat dishes, with the Octopus being a highlight. Paella was great too, though if youre looking to maximize your variety, i'd say this takes the stomach capacity of 3 tapas. Unfortunately the vegetables were a let down. The best of the bunch was the kale corn salad - refreshing with a roasted pop of flavor from popcorn and quinoa. The tomato, while a valiant effort on the chef's part, was ultimately just not ripe enough. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were a hard pass. It was clear that who ever was frying these  vegetables tonight were off their A game, or simply underqualified. The preparation around the vegetables was good, but the actual plant matter was way over fried - half burned honestly. Still, the night was propped up by the rest of the meal. I'd come back.
pos	Love the place. The paella is great. The sushi style croquette is unique and tasty. Arrived early so no wait time.
pos	Delicious tapas,cocktails tend to be on the sweeter side.Good wine selection.Service is good. ❤️Trio of desserts
pos	Ambiance is awesome. Drinks (specials) are quality. Food hit and miss. Of about 10 tapa style options really liked only tuna tacos. Rest had too much goo (spiced mayonnaise or hummus or batter or some other taste or coating "filler") to count as a dish.  It's probably the best tapas you can get immediately adjacent to Stanford , but expect to just enjoy ambiance and drinks, don't fill up on 'goo' too much.
pos	Came here for a one year anniversary and really enjoyed the ambiance here even in COVID! What I thought was super awesome was how fast the food came and how attentive the staff was. I will say portion sizes were on the smaller end even for the massive paella but the quality was high - standout was the crab croquette for sure and the cute chocolate cake the staff provided was also super nice as a service! Would come again.
pos	Worth the drive!!! Great food, ambience and service! Highly recommend the crab Croquette, Paella Negra and Pulpo Telefèric!
pos	Celebrated a work promotion and came here with 4 people on a Monday night.  It was quite busy but we arrived on time for our reservation and were seated promptly.  The service was excellent and he came to check on us a few times.  Food and drinks were amazing and we're glad there's a closer place than walnut creek to San Jose.  Look forward to coming back.
pos	The paella lobster and brussels sprouts are very delicious. However it's pretty expensive and they charge 20% tips automatically.
neu	Ambience of the restaurant was good but food was a big disappointment... We ordered 3 tapas, paella and sangria.  Each tapas felt missing something, I felt they were tastless or greasy 😔  Paella was okish, doesn't worth over 50$ for sure and sangria was almost like a lemonade but more watery. Service was great tho, people are really nice. That's why 3 stars but food wasn't tasty..
pos	Girl's night birthday dinner here was beautiful.  I love sangria and they had multiple choices as well as an option for a flight of all three.  We shared a bunch of appetizers and a paella and it was all delicious.  So good that I brought home leftovers and had a tasty lunch the next day.
pos	Been here twice, ordered pretty much the same food. Besides the lobster paella, my favs are the pork belly with corn and the cauliflower. Next time I’ll try some new stuff, looking forward:)
pos	We had an early Mother's day lunch this Saturday and the experience was lovely. Wait time without reservation was under 5 minutes. Everyone was very attentive and provided prompt service at every step despite being so busy. The mixed paella was delicious and flavorful, I loved the ham croquetas but the queso board so good too.
pos	I am so happy we decided to pay this place a visit when we were in Palo Alto. Exceptional food, attentive service and really fun drinks! I highly recommend!
pos	This place Does. Not. Miss. The tapas are light, delicious, inventive, and plated beautifully. Their outdoor dining setting is also one of the most festive in Palo Alto. We loved the ahi tuna taquitos, Iberian oysters, and salmon tartar, although the surprise of the night was the Spanish tomato—it’s incredible.
pos	We went to the restaurant with my friend, the food was delicious. Paella , salads, desserts, coffee. but for some reason the tip was already included 20%. the waiter did not warn me.   TAKE NOTE OF THAT.
pos	My friend recommended this restaurant to me and this is my first time here. The restaurant has a great atmosphere inside and the staff was friendly. They are super quick and reliable when it comes to refilling drinks. We ordered the patatas bravas, pulpo teleferic, and paella lobster, highly recommend. Will definitely come back again.
pos	The lobster paella and octopus was the best! We ordered other items but these two dishes really stood out. The cocktails were good as well. The spicy sangria was my favorite!
pos	Highly recommended! Definitely felt like dining in Spain, with excellent tapas..maybe a half star off for noise, but, hey, the place was packed..and one can eat outside, which was quieter. The tuna tacitos merited a second order! Gratuity included in the bill, a practice I welcome.
pos	A great experience. the restaurant is dynamic, cheerful and the customer service is spectacular. We loved the food, tuna tacos, croquettes, rice with lobster and meat. thanks for the dinner we had, we will repeat some day for sure
neu	Food was OK, but in my opinion quite overpriced considering the portion size, especially the paella’s. Overall presentation was good. Cocktails were well made (nice touch on the smoking mojito). Staff was friendly and accommodating. Covered outdoor seating with heaters (Covid19). Plenty of parking.
pos	What a great place to have some amazing tapas and insanely tasty Spanish food! Lively and mildly lit table(personal preference!) Tried a variety of dishes from the menu and everyone turned out to be great. King crab cakes to meatballs to seared skirt steak with bone marrow cream to 🥘 paella to Choco magic... the list goes on and on... Great collection of cocktail! Service was just amazing! The person show waited our table was very polite and respectful!  pointed out favorites..
pos	Very tasty food. It was way better than expected. The food is definitely 5 stars. The seating outside was ok but not matching the quality of the food. The heaters were only available for outside of the tent which was not very pleasant. I guess diving at covid days
pos	This place is special. This is not your typical "Spanish tapa" wannabe casually interpreted with American standards and pallet. The entire food lineup makes a genuine attempt to deliver delicious Spanish tapas and for the most part they absolutely nail it. Ingredients are fresh. The sauces and garnish is just enough. Each dish has a "slight" flaw, almost enough to actually make it believe that yes, not the original chef craft is lost in translation. But it is ever so well done. The pulpo (octopus) was grilled to perfection but the sauce was slightly bland. The crab croquets blended cheese perfectly but the innards were slightly lukewarm. Churros could've been a bit more crispier. The steak a bit more gentle. It was perfect with the hint of human. And then the paella negra... this was something from heaven. Perhaps a pinch too much salt but oh boy, what a treat, rare to find in the Bay Area let alone perhaps the entire West Coast.  A bit on the pricey side but it is in the the middle of Palo Alto. And yes, it is worth every cent. Will return, with anticipation.
pos	Fantastic authentic Spanish food. Excellent tapas, good paella. Covid safe outdoor dining. Highly-recommended.
neu	Cute restaurant and good customer service. Really great virgin drinks and amazing ham croquetas. However, the outdoor seating area is crowded - passersby often walk by really close to your table. Still, I would’ve rated the restaurant higher if not for a couple of potential health hazards. 1) I ordered a shrimp tapa and only noticed the shrimp was not properly deveined when I sat down to eat the leftovers at home. 2) The menu doesn’t list all major ingredients. So, I purchased the salad not knowing it was full of sunflower seeds (luckily I’m not allergic - I just dislike them).
pos	Amazing food with impeccable service. Really enjoyed their seafood paella , loved their Brussel sprout and crab croquette! Having had dinner there thrice and always wanting to come back.
pos	Telerific Barcelona has turned into one of my favorite spots in the south bay. Came to get some dinner here after many months and the experience was very similar to last time. The staff is friendly and courteous starting from the time you check in for your reservation all the way to the end of your meal. Highly recommend starting your evening with a Sangria Barceloneta, Crab Croquettes and Pulpo Telerific. The Crab Croquettes were nice and crunchy on the first bite followed by the wave of juicy flavorful crab. The Pulpo was cooked to perfection and was delicious when combined with the accompanying sauce. Wrapped up the meal with some Churros and it was the best I've ever had.
pos	From start to end was excellent and super fast service.  Cocktails are well presented and very tasty.  Totally recommend, will definitely go back with friends to have some tapas and good Cocktails.
pos	You can grab space at the bar if it’s busy and you have no reservation. It’s a great ambience with lots of seating and it really feels like the L’example Barcelona high-end tapas restaurant vibe.  Enjoyed the gambas, Croquettes, and patatas bravas. Cocktails are great. Clientele is also solid, met some interesting people!  This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Peninsula right now!
pos	🇪🇸 Great food, casual upscale ambieance, outdoor seating that’s dog friendly.  We focused on the Tapas and they didn’t disappoint.  Every dish was on point.  Service was excellent.  Cocktails presented very well. Attached store selling Spanish foods/wine is connected to restaurant area. Probably as close as you can get to an authentic Barcelona Tapas experience in the Bay Area.
pos	Grilled octopus, pork belly, grilled mixed vegetables, and, definitely, the dessert platter. And before I forget, the salmon tartar is devine. Your stomach and brain will thank you. The cauliflower tapas plate and pumpkin soup are OK. The flat bread is a great accompaniment, as other dishes have no grain.  All in all, great Spanish food in a lovely ambience. The wait staff tries, but even at 1800 hrs you have to work a bit to get their attention.  If you are on a budget, check prices of even the flat water ($6).
pos	Come for the paella but try to get a seat at the bar so you can watch the cocktailsmithing in action.
pos	Love the grilled crunchy octopus! Squid ink paella also delicious. Meatballs a bit salty. Overall every dish we tried was very good. Be aware that they charge $5.50 per bottle of flat water. But would very likely come back.
pos	I am a huge fan of this place. We love everything here. The only complaint is with the Catalan Tomahawk, it’s really not worth it. Half is not eatable. Definitely will not recommend, better eat everything else. Much much better!
pos	The Argentinian and Spanish guys at the bar really rock, cool folks.  It was unexpected that the Prime Wellington was sliced beef inside a pastry. Menu could be more clear.
pos	This place has very good food and nice atmosphere.  The dishes we very well prepared and reminded us of Barcelona. This place lost a star from me because the service could use some improvement. A server came 3 times with dishes we didn't order. One of dishes didn't arrive for a long while. Happy to update this review when this improves.
pos	Today I had a great time at this new place Teleferic! They just opened not to long ago and the food is to die for, the service is great and ambiance is amazing. They’re also open all day even when a lot of the near by restaurants are closed so it’s a great lunch location. The night life is popin and they have great music to listen to while eating.
pos	Top notch food, both for takeaway and dine in. We sat outside and were very happy with the precautions taken to make it safe during Covid. The crab croquettes, tuna taquitos, and patatas bravas are DIVINE!
pos	We came here for the first time, grabbing one of the set menu items. Though many dishes were included, the star was head and shoulders above the rest.  The Paella Mixta offers a variety of toppings, with the seafood outshining them all. Octopus tentacles tender that surrender to the smallest bite, fresh shrimp perfumed with saffron, and a wonderfully smooth rice to coating it all. The accompanying chicken and ribs, while surprisingly dry, did not take too much away from the dish as a whole.  If you are coming here for the first time, shoot for the Paella Lobster and pair it with a glass of red or white - you can’t go wrong.
pos	This was a great place for the early afternoon to evening. The drinks were tasty, unique, and refreshing. Presentation was done well. The food was flavorful as well which made the experience worthwhile.
neu	This is a 4-star food experience but it's priced at 5 stars, netting me out at 3 stars.  We came here as a party of three on a Saturday night. We made a reservation and were seated promptly at 6:30pm. There were a few heaters, though nowhere near enough for all the space they have going on outside, and we were definitely cold.  We shared a few tapas and a bottle of wine. The wine, as at any restaurant, was super marked up. That said, there were few, if any, bottles under $50, which isn't a tiny starting place. The bottle we had was good, but nothing mindblowing for a $74 price tag.  Awesome things you should order? Pulpo Telefèric hands down. This was the bite of the night. The octopus was PERFECTLY grilled the truffle wasn't overpowering, and the pimentón potato puree was flavorful.  Things that were good? La Porco - pork belly served with grilled corn (really flavorful and grilled nicely) and mojo verde (I could spread this on everything). Brussels Sprouts - not sure what they were served with, it almost tasted like whipped butter, but they were crispy outside and tender inside. Jamón Ibérico - sliced paper thin, enough to share with 4-5 people.  Things to skip? Crab Croquettes - the tuna sashimi on top was actually quite tasty, but the croquette itself just wasn't good, it didn't have any real flavor, it was overly fishy, and the consistency was crab meat with mayo that went through a blender, vs. actual chunks of crab meat. Gambas al Ajillo - also overly fishy, as if they weren't fresh. Had they been fresh they would have been tasty, these are large prawns served head on, but they made me feel a bit sick. Pan con Tomate - I prefer a toasted bread and the tomato didn't really have much flavor. I was looking for more garlic and perhaps some herbs.  I'm curious about some of their other dishes, and I'd come back with a bigger group (6-8) to try more things, but for 2-4 people, this ends up being a hefty price tag for a meal that's just good.
pos	The seafood paella is amazing, highly recommended. Various tapas and deserts are delicious too. Reservation is preferred. Only opened for dinner time. Excellent service.
pos	Absolutely delicious! Everything was spot on.
pos	Nice dishes & nice environment! Recommend cocktail teleferic - made from red wine and berries & the calamari with squid ink dip - it seems the day's special. ;) We also ordered king crab croquette, steamboat oyster, chicken empanadas, churros con chocolate - all are of good quality!
pos	This place offers really good Barcelona/basque cuisine. Ambience is great for lunch. The Puleo, seafood paella negra, crab croquettes are really good. Pulpo and seafood are very fresh, tender and tasty. The empanada is not what I was expecting. It’s really just fried wantons with chicken. The pinchos are so-so. The pallirada verdura that we ordered didn’t come at all so we cancelled.
pos	Great food!  We had the gambas, the flat bread and the octopus and they were all great, but the star of the meal was the cauliflower - absolutely fantastic. Also super friendly and quick service. Highly recommended.
pos	Excellent flavors. The octopus and kale salad were awesome! The gazpacho soup was tangy and very refreshing. We ordered food online and had a easy pick up experience. Everything was packaged well. Decided to have an impromptu picnic in the trunk of the car.
pos	Love the paella negra! Make sure to ask for the "socarrat" version of it!
pos	Taste of Spain. You won’t be disappointed here. All of the foods that we had were excellent, exquisitely prepared. Berries sangria was so refreshing, the corn tortilla paired so well with salmon tartare. My favorite one must be the grilled octopus, so flavorful, tender and yet just the right hint of spices. Be sure to make reservation if you are planning to come here.
neg	Don't order from them. There is always an issue with orders: 30mns late, 30mns early, missing item ... And they never offer anything to apologize. If you are lucky and you seat there the food is good though. Just don't order
pos	I don’t remember I liked tapas as much when I visited Barcelona. The food here was great and delicious. I enjoyed every dish we ordered even though some flavors were new to me. My favorites were the paella dishes and specifically the black one. The staff was super attentive and responsive.
pos	Good food, good service! We love and Recommend the tuna tacos! Paella not so sure I’m impressed.
pos	I was skeptical, as I am always with Spanish restaurants outside Spain, but I really loved the Teleferic in Palo Alto. A Spanish restaurant with a clear Catalan influence as the star in the menu is the rice and the selection of wines has lots of Penedés, Priorats and Cavas.  Lovely "croquetas", nice seafood rice (the purists won't call it paella, but it was great), good wine selection and an amazing Gin&Tonic Spanish style!!  And they also have a small store of Spanish products. This place is very nice!
pos	Tasty! Love Lobster paella and the mimosa!
pos	Delicious food with fairly decent service. It was packed and noisy while I was there, but the food was authentic and excellently prepared. I highly recommend the crab croquette, octopus, and burrata salad. For dessert, my money is on the torrejas – to die for. The gin cocktails are some of the best around. Pricey for "standard" Spanish food, but considering the fact it's one of the few Spanish restaurants in the area, that's what you're paying for. Recommended. Will be back.
pos	My husband & I were looking for a place with outdoor dining that still had a romantic touch for our anniversary. We came across Telefèric and we are so glad we did. The food was presented beautifully and had so much flavor but subtle at the same time (if that makes sense)! I had a passion friend monitor and it had dry ice in it giving it the smokey look, they called it a gothic drink & it definitely gave me that vibe. We’ll be here again soon for sure!!
pos	Pretty tasty Paella with fresh ingredients.
pos	Really liked this place! 🇪🇸 If you're not having paella, I would highly recommend tapas, going for the cheese (quesos) board, the pan de tumato and the jamón! They also have really good traditional Spanish beers!  Would definitely go back! 😋
pos	Everything was delicious. You have to be sure to book a reservation at least a couple weeks in advance if you want to be able to get in here. We were only able to get a reservation at 4:45 on a weekend. The place was already half full as well. Their service was very good and the food was delicious.
pos	Great place, delicious food and drinks! I would highly recommend to focus on tapas: the variety and taste are incredible!
pos	had a fabulous AUTHENTIC Spanish dinner there Sunday. The Pulpo (Octopus) was cooked to perfection moist and delicious. The Croquetas de Jamon we a perfect combination of savory. and the gambas al ajillo were juicy and we used EVERY bit of bread to soak up the juices and sauce!  as a native Spaniard I can vouch for the authenticity.  we will be back.
pos	My new favorite!!! Outdoor seating available. Enzo was amazing server. Virgin drinks were refreshing
pos	Love coming to this restaurant. Always such a nice atmosphere and pleasant staff. I always get the sangria here as well as the papas. Would highly recommend
pos	We had a birthday gals night and for the three of us ladies we ordered a lot. Everything was delicious the octopus, crab croquette, kale salad, jamon with tomato bread, the mix paella, the potatoes and the house sangria red wine was really nice too! Service was A++++ this has got to be the most down to earth best service I've ever had and they helped took a picture, divided our drinks and keep the birthday cake even gave us the candles and wrap it back up like new after all was done. Super impressed and would definitely come here again and spread the words around. Perfect hang out or girls night place!
pos	The staff are all super attentive, caring, and accommodating. But what is more, is that their food is to die for. Incredibly delicious… so much flavor from all the ingredients. Came here few times to try out everything on the menu. You must get the chance to try everything as well but I would say… the oysters, the fish tacos, the meatballs, the crab paella were my favorite!!!
pos	I love their food. They look tasty and fancy. The place is awesome. Service is good
pos	Great takeout from their store, El Merkat, next door. They offer very nice set meals for two.
pos	Wonderful friendly service. Lively atmosphere. Beautifully presented flavorful tapas and entrees.
neu	Cocktails were amazing and food had a fantastic presentation. Staff was a bit confusing bringing out wrong tapas and forgetting tapas. Biggest disappointment was the taste of food. Pan con tomatoes not authentic and too oily. Tomatoes bitter. Calamari with little octopus and too much heavy fried batter. Croquettes were fine but don’t be afraid of putting pieces of ham in it. Meatballs were underwhelming. Too bad you just don’t do albondegas with a yummy red sauce. Would have loved to seen Bacalou fish on the menu. Also, what is up with a 20% surcharge on the menu? Just adjust your prices.
pos	Wonderful place, delicious food, great service. We had a wonderful time!
pos	Good Spanish-style tapas. Pork belly is delicious. Portions are a little small considering the price range, but the food is tasty and the ambience pleasant. Conscientious of gluten free options and can even cook in a separate fryer if asked to do so. Recommend the traditional paella rather than the squid ink. Friendly staff.
pos	Never had this type of cuisine. It was really good from the drinks to their foods.
pos	Beautiful and tasty drink! Great service and delicious tapas. We ordered chicken, crab, salmon and Potato tapas(this one is amazing)
pos	The octopus and sangria are so incredible. Highly recommend the ahi tuna taquitos as well, they’re so fun! Paella was thinner than expected, but still delicious. If you order a Paella, the Socarrat style is definitely a must
neg	We were very disappointed in our meal here. The veggie paella was boring---practically no flavor---and my gambas al ajillo (grilled prawns) had the same problem: no flavor except for the flavor of the prawns themselves. I expected at least a garlic flavor. The prawns themselves were good but I've had better. My wife didn't like her churros, and worst of all, the $29 sangria (with champagne) just tasted like lemonade to me. Not even close to an exotic treat. For these prices, the food needs to be 10 times better to consider it a good value and fun experience. Not going back.
pos	Absolutely delicious tapas. 4 stars for atmosphere because it gets really noisy when eating inside
pos	Very authentic Mexican food. Tasty and first time trying these dishes. The mix drinks were so good
pos	Seafood paella is very very tasty. The seafood is very fresh, all the natural sweetness comes through. The execution needs to be improved... by the time the paella gets to the table, it's not that hot already and there is no crust in the rice. The aioli did not add to the looks nor the taste of the dish. Crab croquettes tonight was well executed. The ham croquettes would have been much better dish if the execution is good (i.e. the mash is runny inside and the iberico ham bits are too big and some arr chewy). The fried calamari presentation is great and the preparation is unique, but not everyone liked it. The octopus leg was very fresh and taste like the ocean but the preparation called for a quick flash fry instead of slow cook, so the result is kinda chewy and you can feel every single suction cup (as they are firm) as you chew and pass the piece around inside your mouth. Overall, great tasty dishes, but more fine tuning is needed.
neu	The vibe of the place is good. Food is good but not enough portion for the prize. Please make reservations ahead as they are always booked.
pos	Large drink menu, delicious food and a fantastically attentive staff. A must try.
pos	All the dishes we ordered were delicious. The best ones were Pulpo Teleferic, Empanadas and Paella Negra. The octopus was cooked to perfection. Very rarely, even in Spain or Portugal, it's possible to find octopus that good.
pos	Halloween special drink! The haunted soul! Yummy tapas and paella! The grilled octopus was so good!
pos	Proper spanish food with an american touch. Helpful and kind staff. We had croquetas, lobster rice and some tacos, also steaming bubbling mojitos! and good selection of spanish wine. Must try if around Palo Alto area.
pos	Great tapas and paella. I like the ham croquette.
pos	The service here is very informative, friendly, and great. The tapas are fun and delicious. The chicken empanadas, calamares, and tuna ahi tacos were the best ones. We also ordered the lobster paella for 4 and it came with a whole lobster. So yummy!
pos	absolutely loved it and definitely will be back next time i'm in town. Great Tapas, beautiful drinks, and delicious paellas!
pos	Great food, friendly employee. Super expensive, I  spent $60 for a decent (or small) amount of food 😂😂 ( food  plus tip), and that was for lunch.
pos	Bustling establishment with amazing service and food. Paella was more like risotto (soft)
pos	Wonderful place if you want to enjoy Spanish food with a twist. Service is incredible and chefs behind amazing. Highly recommended
pos	Spectacular, energetic atmosphere.  I highly recommend you to try it out.  Make sure to take time to converse and relax.  Side note: Sundays are extremely busy - so worth the wait.
pos	It was so delicious! 🤤 Thank you!
pos	The food is delicious! We sat out on the patio on a nice warm summer night and had a great evening.
pos	Pork belly is extremely tender and skin is super crispy. Jamon tastes just like what we had in Barcelona. Tapas options are a bit limited.
pos	Great variety of tapas, get the squid ink paella and tomahawk steak (huge)
pos	For me, this is a good restaurant but not great. Always packed, they have interesting cocktails and good selection of food. Before they were just too many selections, today the food menu has been paired down a bit but still something to please everyone. Service is good but not great and a little bit chaotic. Some people love this place. I like it but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.
neg	Tapas dishes & cocktails were terrific BUT paella and desserts were horrible. Most of all the place wasn't clean and service was awful, (1) We waited 15 minutes to be seated, even though we had a reservation. They clearly did not reserve a table for us. (2) Chairs were filthy and the table was falling apart, you can't charge $80 a person and serve the food in such conditions (3) Outdoor seating did not have proper heating. We had to ask for a heater 3 times, and they eventually got one working on a low setting to save on propane.
pos	Nice place, I been here in the day and at night. I recommend going at night time, it has a better vibe. The food is so good!
pos	Sensational food. Everything was spot on from drinks to service and food. The ham croquettes were stupendous. The Paella was rich and delicious. Trio desert was magnificent to top it off. Excellent drinks. Highly recommend.
pos	Great food. Highly recommend the tapas. The paella was just ok
neu	I SO wanted to like this place, but for the price they charge for the Paellas, they were beyond average! Undercooked rice, and no salt in one of the paellas we ordered, and the second - 'lobster/seafood paella' had so little seafood that it's a shame they charge upwards of 60$ for it. Plus, our server either forgot our order or messed something up, and it took more than an hour (from the time we ordered) to get dinner. Only plus - the indoor ambiance is nice, and the small plates/appetizers weren't too shabby. Oh, best part - for a party of 4, they added a mandatory gratuity of 20% (even with the sub-standard service we received). Definitely not returning again.
pos	Great food, service and atmosphere! Perfect for a date or a good night out
pos	Restaurant is owned by a Spanish native and the food brought back all the beautiful memories of my Spanish adventures.  The sangria is authentic and the wine selection very tasteful.  All the tapas were excellent.   I'd love to go back again when I'm in the area.
neu	Cool vibe and friendly service.  We had several of the tapas (octopus, empanadas, ham croquetas) and split an order of the paella mixta. Aside from a few of the dishes tasting a bit too salty, nothing else really stood out.
pos	Great customer service and really good food. We ordered a Paella and it was enough for 2 people. I would advise you to book an appointment (it is busy). In spite of the fact there were many customers, food arrived really fast. Ps. I will be back to try that secreto ibérico!
pos	Loved the paella carne! And definitely try the spicy sangria.
pos	Amazing tapas. The Spanish wine and cheese are to die for. Glad to have one close by!
pos	One of the most efficient restaurants in the entire Bay area. Always consistent. Reasonable prices. Quality meat and ingredients. Never disappoint. The mango drinks are very good. Can't wait till the pandemic is over and the complementary hot tea is back on the counter.
pos	Highly recommend the Paella Negra with Squid Ink, nearly as good as we remember in Barcelona. The La Porca is very tasty.
pos	Amazing place that’s found its voice. The Peninsula officially has a great Spanish Restaurant. The “Turkish Rose Gin & Tonic” is also a nice Mediterranean touch!
pos	Fantastic Paella and dessert. The combination is the best by far.
neu	Made a reservation on line Tuesday for Saturday. The options available were 4:45pm or 8:30pm so selected 4:45pm.  Saturday's fun began at  Lucie Stern theater with the TheaterWorks performance of "It is a Wonderful Life." A wonderful performance! The play had no intermission so ended by 3:30pm so we headed to the restaurant. Parking at the shopping center is very tight but managed to park near the restaurant. We had tea & coffee at Pete's until our dinner reservation time.  When we got to the restaurant at 4:30pm there was a line to check in.  I asked to seat indoors because I didn't want my wife to freeze out in the patio seating. Sorry, no indoor seating available.  The table for two was located four feet from the front grill of an SUV.  The place is trendy & popular. The restaurant store was closed for a private party. Most customers are young out to be seen. The owners of the SUV by our table needed attention so they went back and forth to their SUV multiple times turning on & off they alarm with headlights flashing & horns blasting.  The busboy brought us two waters and soon after the waitress brought the food & drink menus. My wife ordered a champagne with pink lemonade sangria. We picked two appetizers. Crab croquetas & meat empanadas. The appetizers were full of flavors with excellent presentation.  We also ordered pork, roasted chicken and mushroom paella. The paella had two normal servings and was tasty; however, the appetizers had much better taste & presentation than the paella. My wife had a delicious decaf coffee & I got the bill that included a 20% gratuity.  The best part of the dinner experience was the appetizers and the worst was seating in front of the grill of an SUV that kept flushing it's headlights & blasting it's horn
pos	Great food , nice drinks, good environment, friendly servers. A little bit expensive but over all good experience.
pos	Loved the ham croquetes and calamari
pos	good tapas, OK paella
neu	The paella was delicious. The rest of the dishes were just ok (pulpo, cauliflower, gambas, and oysters) - with a touch more seasoning, and acid/herbs for brightness they could be much better. For $200 for 2, my expectations were not quite met. Service was great and the concept is right on. A little more focus on execution in the kitchen and we would go more often and could recommend it to our crew.
neu	Too much sauce on all the food (bravas and lobster paella esp). Paella kinda tasted just like burnt garlic. A few wine options on menu not available. Nice vibe, good outdoor seating, and great service though!
neu	Ordered the lobster paella, salmon tartar, grilled octopus, cauliflower. Seafood is fresh but overall food is too salty. Pricing is also extremely high for mediocre flavors in the Paella.
pos	Think the service, ordering & experience was great. But the food left more to be desired - definitely didn't feel the paella's were worth the $40 charge. The weekdays do half the portions & wouldn't mind checking out then.
neg	My friends and I decided to go to this restaurant because we are from Spain and we wanted to try it out. The food was good although they charged us automatically 20% of gratuity and it was only 4 of us. It just seemed unethical. If you go, check your receipt before paying!
pos	Very fresh seafood.
neg	Made a reservation for outside, went to check for the reservation, they said it was for inside and cannot accommodate outside seating. we had to leave, very bad customer experience.
pos	Everything served were delicious! Will definitely go back
pos	Amazing experience! We sat at the bar, Alejandro and the other bartenders were exquisite at what they do! The drinks were my favorite! So many WOW factors to the drinks! My second fav was the octopus appetizer!!!! I will most definitely be back to try more.
pos	Excellent services and food!!! We ordered Brussels sprouts and octopus, most delicious however the lobster paella is too salty and portion is small :(
pos	I've eaten here numerous times in the last year and each time I'm delighted. Their veggie paella is my favorite dish. All of the food is excellent and their service is top notch.
pos	Simply one of my favorites in San Jose.  Just go. Eat the jamon.
pos	The food was amazing. The portions could have been a little better for the price (and I understand perfectly that these are tapas). Overall, nice ambiance and experience.  The staff was really nice.  This is a really nice place to meet up with friends. I would definitely go again.
pos	Insanely popular. Food pretty good, not stellar. The only dish I end up craving is the watermelon tomatoes. The paella is ok when done crispy.
pos	Food was delicious. Our main dishes were lobster paella and squid ink paella. We enjoyed both. Service was great too. We will definitely visit again.
pos	Yet one more fantastic place to eat in Town & Country! The mall needs to expand their parking because this place is going to draw a crowd! It was packed on a Saturday night and that's not surprising. Outstanding tapas, presented beautifully, and excellent service. Also try their craft cocktails -- WOW! I am going to become a regular here! I also like that they just include gratuity. Just figure out the numbers for me, I don't want to do math after I've been drinking!
neu	They impose a 20% gratuity for lunch and include additional suggested tip in the bill.  If the service was worth it, I'd take it, but it's not worth it. I've just seen similar complaints in other comments.  Even if they reply that a 20% gratuity can be removed by the manager, why should I make the extra effort to contact the manager when you automatically charge 20%?  What if someone doesn't notice and leaves another 18% tip?  You're wasting your customers’ trust.
neg	Food okay for the most part. Desert was inedible, chocolate ganache was salted like a salad. Service good. Music horrible. The place is supposed to be Spanish but they played loud cheap Latin American pop (not to my taste, no disrespect to others who like that music.) We sat inside and at some point a bad smell came out of the kitchen, smelled like a rotting ash tray. Did not appreciate that they added 20% service fee to the bill. I like to decide how much I add myself and not be told. Definitely will NOT return.
neu	Love this place but the Walnut Creek one is way better. Definitely do not recommend the gazpacho- they use WAY too much olive oil. There are noticeable globs of oil floating in it. Disappointing because I absolutely love gazpacho and making it at home but this just did not meet my expectations.
pos	Great upscale atmosphere and service. Each menu item i’ve tried has tremendous flavors and textures. Paella is great to share for 2. The dessert was most interesting.. forgot the name but it had a cotton candy ice cream and a few other dollups of amazing ice creams. Highly recommend.
pos	Awesome appetizers. Brussel sprouts and potatoes were amazing. So we're the cocktails.
pos	Great ambiance, fantastic food and service!
pos	Excellent and authentic Spanish/Catalonian food. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere outside could be better if a few nice separators were installed between tables. Tables are crammed close together, and with loud neighbors, it was hard to follow the conversion at your own table.
neg	I was expecting something worthy of the hefty price tag (especially since it was featured on The Eater) but I was sadly let down. Don't get me wrong, the food was good as was the atmosphere, but there is something about Spanish tapas that always feels like a gimmick (small plates and small servings and a large bill with gratuity automatically included really rubs me the wrong way). I had the Halloween inspired drink...which was, as others have stated, Instagram worthy but really lacked in flavor and punch (for $16 plus 20% gratuity, it better hit hard...and it doesn't). My next drink was the Pedro's Break...again more gimmick than function as the smoked element really overpowered the whole thing. Food was along the same lines - Ham croqeuttes and the Corte Iberico which were both beautifully presented and tasty but really lacking in size. I was sorely disappointed with the quality of the steak as well since it was a bit overcooked and the flavor wasn't nearly as great as I imagined it. Needless to say, you shouldn't be able to cook a better meal than an upscale restaurant or make better drinks as a home cook/bartender...and there was nothing here that I couldn't do better. It was nice to try it but it wasn't worth the $110 I paid. I'm not independently wealthy and my tastebuds work so this is a pass for me.
pos	Lively, fun and friendly place to dine solo, with friends or family. It has robust energy from service to the food served. The appetizers -patatas bravas, croquettes, empanadas and octopus-are delicious and an adornment to the table. However, the Spurrata Paella is a big disappointment. It literally lacks seafood. The taste, though is very distinctive. The list of Spanish wines is wonderful!
pos	Everything was good!!! Service was excellent. Will come back 😍
neg	This place is all smoke and mirrors. Churros were soggy with oil, ~$40 paellas barely fed a single person and the drinks were all watered down with ice. Ambience is nice but the food is tasteless and overpriced. Also a 20% gratuity was automatically charged for my table of 2.
pos	Paella is excellent. Wonderful service. New favorite place now.
neg	we had a outdoor seat,  the seating looks primitive - not as we expected. we ordered Grilled Octopus,  Crab Croquettes, Gambas al Ajillo, and Paella Negra. the only dish we like is Crab Croquettes, all other taste OK, mostly too salty, the rice in Paella Negra seem undercooked. a few time waiter come as soon as we almost finish the dish - make us feel we are rushed to finish our meal. finally we ask for check, and surprised the restaurant add 20% of "food cost and tax" on top of the bill - not deserve it with the ambience, food and service. and charge 20% on Tax, too?
pos	The place is cute, but food is overpriced, considering the quality of the food. The portion is relatively small, and sea food is not that fresh. For example, you can taste that the lobster is soggy, not fresh crispy meaty flavor.
neu	I would give 5, stars because service  and food were amazing, BUT it was disappointing that my husband mentioned we were going to be celebrating our wedding anniversary when he made the reservation and I also mentioned it when we were seated at our table and unfortunately the staff didn't bother to do something cute/special for us.  I probably wouldn't recommend for a wedding anniversary dinner, if you want something a little more special.  For a regular night, I would totally recommend since the food and drinks are amazing.
neu	Tapas and drinks were fine.  Beware the Merkat, though.  They will substitute items, without consulting you.  So,if you’ve selected items, continued to look around, and finally get around to the cashier,  do ensure that the items are what you expect.  I had my sherry substituted with a vermouth??? His explanation, the sherry not dry as I’d requested, but really should have said something before ringing it up.  And with vermouth?  Oh my.
pos	Upscale joint with great food. It is perfect for special occasions or whenever you’re willing to splurge. You can’t go wrong with any of the tapas and definitely not with the vegetable dishes. My personal favorite tapa is the tuna taquitos. Paella mixta was good, but a tad bland in my opinion. The California spin on the dishes makes them very unique.
neg	On Father's day ordered a take out from the Palo Alto branch. One of the items , the crab croquettes was not at all as shown in the online ordering menu , had only 2 pieces instead of 4. The paella which is supposed to be lobster paella is actually shrimp paella with hardly any lobster in it but the customer is being charged a whopping $46 for the same. I understand that these are tough times and restaurants are struggling to stay afloat but as a customer not getting what you pay for or what is being shown in the menu feels like being cheated. The only reason I chose this place is because we have dined in there before and the food was very nice but this time they really disappointed us!
pos	Best Spanish restaurant I've tried in the Bay area by far. The ham croquetas, the octopus and the black paella are my favorites. They also have Estrella Galicia, a very popular Spanish beer. Great value for the extraordinary quality of food.
pos	Best Paella and Sangria I've had outside of Spain
pos	THE FOOD WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I will be dreaming about their brussel sprouts for the rest of my life. The service was fantastic - our server Alejandra was super attentive. Will definitely be going there again & highly recommend others visit asap
pos	Great experience! The hostess found us a table despite the traffic. Favorite restaurant of our trip to California. Great selection of wine. The Spanish ham was exquisite!
pos	Good service and food, though a little on the expensive size and smaller portions for their paella.
neg	We came here on the Saturday 2pm, there are tons of open tables in outdoor area, at least 4 open tables are available for 2 people. We are the first guest in line during that time. The front lady told us if we don't have a reservation, SHE DIDN'T NOT HOW LONG IS THE WAIT TIME! (If you don't know anything why you stand in the front line?) We tell her here there are at least 4 open spots for 2 people, she told us those are RESERVED. It does not make any sense that there are 4 groups of people reserved the table in the day at the same time and no show at the same time?????? What a joke.  So we put down our phone number and she said she will text us when the table is ready. We waited for an hour, it's already 3 pm, we end up to go somewhere else.  BY THE END OF THE DAY WE NEVE RECEIVE A TEXT MESSAGE FROM THIS RESTAURANT.  Is this restaurant don't accept any walk in customers or it's because we are not white, so she's not welcome us?  I really felt attacked. Very disappoint about the service.  If you are not white, be aware they DON'T WELCOME YOU.  If I hope I could just give 0 star to this restaurant.
pos	One of my favorite dates night restaurants.
pos	We tried bunch of items - chicken empanadas, patatas bravas, cauliflower, kale salad, Brussels sprout, tres leches pudding, sangria. Everything is okay, nothing too flavorful.
pos	It is an ok spot, but may not quite be worth the money. I think Cascal in Mountain View is equally good but a bit cheaper.  I think the seating on the parking lot is not very cozy and heating is limited. Gazpacho is watery. The ret of tapas are good.  And churros are may be the best ones I have tried outside of Spain.
pos	Wow. Great food, service and ambience. We shared a few tapas and they all outshined each other. Fabulous experience. Try the Gambas. And the Patatas Bravas. And the Watermelon Tomatoes. And the Empanadas. It's that good.
neu	First time (lunch) was great: Tasty Spanish food, great and speedy service, pleasant atmosphere.  Second time (dinner) was a big disappointment: the restaurant was dirty and noisy, the waiters mixed up our dishes, one of the dishes came cold and the steak was chewy.
neg	We reached the place at 7.30pm We were 2nd on the waitlist and the party ahead of us went in by 7.35pm. We had a reservation at 8pm for a party of 5 and are still waiting, it’s 8.10pm currently on a Tuesday evening. Several groups came after us and were given a table immediately. Didn’t appreciate not being given a good reason for not seating us. 20% gratuity is added to all orders regardless of group size even before they serve us, what if I’m not that grateful for the service received? Expensive, but the vibe is good.
pos	Great addition to the restaurant scene in Palo Alto. The octopus was excellent. The paella was delicious but here is where I think they could do more to earn my 5th star. While very flavorful, the shrimp were very small. Larger, head-on shrimp would have greatly improved the dish. Dessert trio was excellent. I had a very nice citrus G&T with lemongrass. Great restaurant, great vibe, and very good people as hosts. We will be here frequently.
pos	Stellar service.  Delicious food.
pos	One of my favourite Spanish restaurant in Bay Area. Yummy and friendly staff.
pos	Food, ambiance, and service level are more like 6 stars! If you go, do not miss out on the Spanish meatballs. Best dish of everywhere for all of 2021!
neg	We have been wanting to come for a while and finally made it. Overall, very disappointing. The paella was old tasting and everything in it was overcooked. They make you wait for a while to give you the impression they are cooking these on order, but there is no doubt these are precooked a day before, very dry, lacks color, lacks flavor, meats are old, barely any color.  The shrimp tapas was good, but the shrimp is in a tub of oil. 3 pieces of crostini came with the shrimp for 2$ extra, which was bizarre. Ahi tuna tacos was good. Service was ok, but to charge 20% service at lunch is excessive and not deserved.  Overall, a mediocre food and experience that is way overpriced.  Not worth a try.
pos	Incredibly authentic Catalonian tapas bar, with some of best tapas I've had outside of Barcelona. Incredible cocktails and wine pairings to go along with whatever you pick. There's also 4-5 unique paella options to pick from.
pos	Great service! Great taste! Reasonable price!
pos	Delicious!!!! Absolutely loved the food. Great customer service.
neu	Modified Spanish cuisine. Good service but the food is just ok. Also seems like you don’t get enough food for the price you end up paying. $50 lobster paella has two shrimp, few Small lobster pieces. Cauliflower was, fried soaked in grease.
pos	Food was tasty. Good decor. Kitchen closes at 2pm and staff make you hurry out.
neu	Love their food so been going back often to dine outdoors, but we were dissapointed last time as everything was too salty. They also changed the empanada stuffing. Also costly $$$.
neg	Overpriced.  If you are going to charge $45 for a paella (rice dish), it should very comfortably feed two people (and a to go box). What we got, could not feed one person. Don't be cheap on rice.
neg	We enjoyed the food here (it's our second time here and everything is delicious). But food arrives not consistently, two people in our party finished with their food completely and third person didn't receive anything - not cool! and that was around 4-5 PM, so not the busiest time. Why 1 star? I saw an employee not washing her hands after using the bathroom (at the moment I really hoped that was other guest, but no, later I saw her pouring water to the guests). That happened last weekend and that was a lady with long blond hair wearing black blazer.
pos	Everything was just how I hoped it to be (based on reviews). Great ambience, delicious range of food and drink options, friendly and efficient service, and squeaky clean seating areas + washrooms.
pos	Outdoor and socially distanced. Smooth reservation process. Attentive and friendly, knowledgeable service (traded info with waiter about our recipe for Gazpacho). Awesome tapas: subtle and complex flavors. Pork main dish slightly overdone and under-flavored. Will absolutely go again.
pos	Amazing service and creative dishes. Each cocktail and bite was something to remember.
pos	My wife and I are both from Spain,  and after 10+ years in the Bay Area trying not so good Spanish restaurants we were skeptical to try this new Spanish restaurant. But Telefèric is different. Since the moment we entered we felt we were back in our home country. Nicely decorated restaurant with friendly staff, great atmosphere and tasteful food! The octopus, patatas bravas and shrimps were really good accompanied with Spanish wine and sangria. Highly recommended.
pos	Great cocktails, tapas, and atmosphere. The paellas need to have way more rice and toppings to really make them worthwhile though, especially when you're ordering for big parties of 4+.
pos	Excellent food. Service and ambiance.. Ideal place to eat at if you want to bring guest....will try the Walnut Creek location next time...but most likely to return with other friends.....highly recommend
neg	Good costumer service, but terrible seafood paella,  it was pretty gross flavor, only 2 shrimp and one little langostino. We’ll never go back there.
pos	Every item we ordered on the menu was top notch. Drinks were really great too!
pos	A friend and I checked out this place because some staff came into my work and they were very friendly. We sat at the bar and ate the squid ink Paella and Octopus starter. It was excellent. Service was nice. Pricey compared to Spain but this is Palo Alto. They are crowded for such a new restaurant so be prepared
neu	Not worth the hype
pos	Always delicious. Whether you want to feel like at home, try authentic spanish tapas, or just enjoy a great meal&cocktail this is the perfect spot. We have been several times in the Walnut and Palo Alto locations and have been always a TOP experience. Last Monday we did Croquetas, Bravas, Pulpo, Gazpacho and Paella Negra. I would recommend all of them, specially the Paella if you are a rice lover like me.
pos	Excellent tapas and sangria.  The croquettas in particular were outstanding.  Energetic vibe and attentive service.
pos	Outdoor seating ambiance: romantic. Our server Alejandra: expert. The drinks: magnificent. The tapas: I've been dreaming about them since. More than dinner; an excellent experience.
pos	Great experience. Delicious food, great atmosphere, probably one of the best locations for food in Palo Alto. Can highly recommend.
pos	Great food and even better service. Highly recommend for a fun place to eat.  They have a large wine list and very good hard liquor selection.
neg	Came here on a Sunday around 12 pm for a party of 15 (with 6 kids ages 8 and below) they initially told us they would accommodate us and was getting our tables ready.  Because of COVID we couldn't stay at one big table, which we were fine with splitting. The rest of my party showed up and they saw how many kids we had , then told us they couldn't accommodate us because there is too many kids running around. I told them that's fine I'll take the kids somewhere else while the adults can sit down and eat. They tried to encourage us to order and take it to go. Long story short, they pretty much told us no after saying yes because we had so many kids in our party. Really sad this happened because my mom was a fan of their Walnut Creek location.
pos	Hit or miss with food, grill d octopus was absolutely delicious, brussel sprouts were tasty too. Garlic shrimp was not fresh and very mediocre. Paella was good.
neg	I didn't choose to come here, someone else made a reservations for a small family lunch. After we finished we were all in agreement that we will not be coming back. The service was great, and most people not of my race seem to really enjoy the food here, so I guess it's just not our flavor.
pos	Go now! What an experience! Teleferic is undoubtedly one of the BEST restaurants in the area! Xavi, Maria and their team offer the best service around. We tried various cocktails including The Tourist and Catalan G&T and they were nice and strong. Each food item we ordered was also DELICIOUS. This ranged from the lobster and chicken Paella’s, Crab Croqueta, Spanish meatballs, Tuna tacos (award-winning), Pulpo Telefèric, and the Crispy Pork. Each dish was savored and throughly enjoyed. They were also cooked to perfection and seized our appetites. We are beyond impressed with the service, atmosphere and most of all, the authentic food. What a great addition to the Bay Area and can’t wait to go back!!!
pos	Good Paella, excellent tuna tacos, nice outdoor seating
pos	Goo for Tapas and Paella’s
pos	I first got introduced to Teleferic Barcelona when Chef Oscar and his team did an absolutely fabulous job catering an event for probably 100+ people for a work event. They taught us how to make paella, sangria and also we got to taste some amazing appetizers. There were a few things that struck me about Chef Oscar and his team then: 1) The food is just amazing very flavorful 2) How engaged his team and him were 3) How many veggie options they had alongside seafood and meat options which one would expect Based on the extremely memorable event, my wife and I decided to visit the Palo Alto location. Man what an experience. My wife is vegetarian so most dishes we tried were veggie. The veggie board, the cauliflower and paella were each just super good, full of flavors with excellent service from Katie. The churros were also a great recommendation from Katie. To top it all we ran into Chef Oscar who was very welcoming and remembered my name without I mentioning it - he remembered it from a month back! My wife had a lot of questions about spanish food and he gave us a lot of pointers.He also helped us pickout the bomba rice and iberico ham from the shop at the same location. He also introduced us to Chef Eva who is managing the PA location Overall super impressed and highly recommend
pos	Delicious cocktails and small plates. Love the octopus and a great G&T - highly recommend the Catalan!
pos	The paella was phenomenon!!! Gluten-free and incredibly delicious. Strongly recommend going with the iron pan if you are doing takeout and living nearby.
neg	Sangria is very good. The lobster in paella lobster is not so fresh. It's pretty expensive and they charge 20% tips automatically.
pos	Excellent place. The staff was extremely friendly, food tasted great and to top it off, despite being extremely busy, both the drinks and food were brought out very fast. In addition, we had some very specific requirements around dairy etc. and they made sure to take care of everything we had asked for. My wife and I had a great time here and we will definitely be going back again.
pos	Crown jewel Spanish restaurant in Bay Area
pos	Beautiful, tasty food. We had the roasted cauliflower and gaspacho to start and the 'mixta' paella. Generous portions and gracious service. Highly recommend.
pos	Tables very close. Loud. Good food and different. Mostly younger age people.
pos	Foord and drink are excellent and worth the trip from anywhere in the bay area..
pos	Truly amazing food. We loved paella negra and the tapas. Empanadas are to die for and so is their dessert. We will be back.
pos	Brilliant as always. Save more room for the paella and get the larger one! Highly recommend for vegetarians too!
pos	Very authentic Spanish restaurant with dishes right out of Spain! Best jamon we've had in the bay area (my husband is Spanish), the ham croquetas are so good, trio of desserts also.
neu	The tapas were pretty good, but the paella was quite bad: the rice was burnt, there was basically no seafood nor meat inside of it and the amount was very small.
pos	Fair price for the amazing food and service!
pos	Their paella never disappoints! I recommend the one with squid ink
pos	Loved the food and drinks! Their appetizers are to the top.
pos	Our entire family has a wonderful time at the Teleferic in Palo Alto. The food and service, both were excellent. The cocktails were an added bonus.
pos	Very delicate food
pos	Amazing Cocktails! Great Apps and very friendly servers
neg	The tapas were pretty good, but the paella was AWFUL: the rice was burnt, there was very little seafood inside and it's texture was very hard.
pos	Great location with an amazing decor and a lot of parking up front. The menu is genuine with a lot of dishes straight from Spain. Gambas al ajillo, pulpo but the Jamón Ibérico and the Lobster paella is to die for... great cocktails selections. Red wine sangria and the Catalan G&T with hand cut ice are my favorites!
pos	We made reservations but had to wait 20 minutes. The staff gave us complimentary drinks for the wait. Rest of the service and food was excellent. Would definitely recommend
neg	Was quite disappointed about this place. Although the food looks good, it’s only mediocre. The paella wasn’t flavorful, the kale salad was way too salty, and the churros were undercooked. This alone doesn’t earn 2 stars. I specifically told the waiter that I was allergic to alcohol, and when I ordered a mocktail, he still brought out an alcoholic drink. I may be headed to the ER tonight because of this mistake. The saving grace for the second star was the CORRECT mocktail. It was delicious.  Also, during covid, be wary of this place. They didn’t disinfect the chairs that customers sat in before the next table came.
pos	Amazing place. The drinks were good, the food was so tasty and the service was also great. Definitively looking to come back.  We tried the Spanish croquetas, Taquitos de atún, salmon tartare, Burrata and paella negra.
pos	We had a bunch of shared plates. The octopus appetizer was fantastic. The porter house steak was amazing and so was th paella. All the drinks were good as well.
pos	Excellent place with very good tapas dishers
pos	We come here quite often and have been getting take out during the lockdown.  They have reopened their usual outdoor dining with extra seating in a cordoned off section of the parking lot.  Food and service are at their usual excellent standard.  They have their full menu for both food and drinks.
pos	Being Spaniard and living in California it is hard to find a good place where you can feel like back at home. Teleferic brings you to Spain without leaving the Bay Area. Complete menu, delicious taste and perfect presentation. The staff is really nice and the terrace has a great atmosphere. Will definitely come back more than once. Salud!
neg	It was the most disgusting food I’ve ever had. The lobster paella was so bad it looks like a dog food. I don’t recommend to go there ever. I don’t know how they serve this food to the customers, also it was over priced for the smelly and disgusting food.
pos	Amazing food and ambience
pos	Highly recommend!!
pos	I cannot wait to eat here again. The paella was wonderful. The croquettes were amazing and churros to die for. Alejandra was a sweetheart. We loved it!!!
neg	The food is really good, it really tastes as it should, but the portions are way too small and the place is way too pretentious. They also charge a compulsory 20% tip, which is simply abusive. That's why we aren't going back.
pos	Tasty patatas bravas and paella. Croquettes were creamier than I prefer them. Overall solid but nothing special.
pos	Great food, drinks phenomenal service and atmosphere. Ordered the kale salad, lobster paella, oysters and crab croquettes
pos	I hate to give a rave review because it will up the popularity even more, but they deserve it. I am from. Barcelona. I know tapas. this place has original yet innovative tapas and flavors. and the Black Paella is a must. 5plus stars. gracias.
pos	Great team lunch here. All the food was delicious. Paella was flavored well, really liked the croquettes and brussel sprouts!
pos	Amazing. Thanks Alex for the great service!
neu	Great atmosphere, good tapas. For take-out, too much plastic though, that do not seem to be recyclable. Given price point, they should use compostable containers
pos	Great outdoor and indoor dining. Good for groups . The service was prompt and the food extremely flavorful. Highly recommend trying this out.
pos	Let’s start with the Old Fashion... THE BEST IVE EVER HAD PERIOD... Impure thoughts occurred with every sip... Sorry not sorry... Now the food... Each dish made love to my taste buds... The empanadas dance on my tongue with their crispness and subtle but powerful flavor... The Patatas bravas made me question my life choices... How could I have waited 35 years to taste potatoes like this... And the paella were the Mona Lisa of Paella’s... It was more than a taste... It was an experience.... (In all seriousness this was great food all the way around) Also Jeff was a great server
neu	Tapas are good. Paella is too salty. Overall too pricey given the average environment and service!
pos	We ordered dinner from Teleferic last night through doordash and were having trouble with the doordash service. The manager cared deeply about making sure we got our food, and even offered that if doordash couldn't deliver the food, they would personally do so (a 20min drive each way). He took it on himself to coordinate the issue with doordash, and made sure we got our food. The food was delicious (croquettes, steak, patatas) but the service was just unbelievable. Thank you for truly going above and beyond!
pos	Amazing food and vibe!
pos	I've been to two Teleferic locations in Spain and the one in Walnut Creek. The food, the service, and the staff is amazing and this location in Palo Alto is no different. If you're looking for an authentic Spanish restaurant then this place is definitely worth checking out!  We ordered paella, ham croquettes, and jamon iberico. It was all delicious and the staff helping us were friendly and attentive.  We'll be coming back to Teleferic next time we're in town.
pos	Lovely place! Definitely one of my favourite restaurants in the bay area! I highly recommend the tomahawk and the octopus. Exquisite wine list. Amazing environment!
neg	I was appalled and surprised to see one of my now ex-favorite Restaurants had the brazen business practice to add a 20% gratuity to my bill without my knowledge, Teleferic new business model is to add 20% to your bill without your knowledge that is WRONG.  With COVID and everything else going on I have been giving 20% and up to 50% tip to servers, well deserved. But when a business attempts to deceive his customers, the employees and the business owners are the  losers. I will never go back to Teleferic and neither will my friends. So how much did this business practice cost Teleferic. I guarantee I'm not the only one with this feeling.
pos	The food was creatively presented and quite delicious. The Pulpo was specially well done. I would return to this place in a heartbeat!
pos	Food was really excellent especially the churros, however pretty pricey - $200 for 3 people for Tapas and drinks.
neg	Their waitlist should have a skeleton next to it. 2nd in line. Checked in with the host, was told to "walk" the mall untill we get the call. 30 minutes later, walk done, 10000 steps finished, still no call, so went to a different place. Left name on waitlist, just for curiosity. It's almost 10 pm (closing time) and I'm still 2nd in line. They must really care for our health, since they want their patrons to walk for 4-5 hours before dining. Kudos!
pos	A note about COVID precautions there. While the tables are appropriately spaced and hand sanitizer is placed at every one, I was a bit distressed by the behavior of some of the staff. The hostesses and others (not servers) kept pulling down their masks to speak to one another. And, a member of the team there was delivering food without gloves (and was one of the worst offenders about pulling down his mask). When I pointed out the lack of gloves, it was remedied by the manager. But, my anxiety about what I perceived as somewhat lax attitude about safety precautions interrupted my enjoyment of the meal. Everyone must decide for themselves what their risk tolerance is. Despite the food, drinks, and service being excellent, I don't intend to return until covid is under control.
pos	Food and service are great.
pos	Excellent food, wonderful service!
pos	Crab paella was amazing!! The Ibiza cocktail was very visually pleasing .
pos	There is a shop where they sell Spanish food products. Every time I go there, the staff helps me sample the best of Spain. The staff is amazing - David and Elizabeth in particular - they make you feel like family and treat you as such!
neg	Really bad service. We waited on three tapas for over thirty minutes while the table next to us had arrived and gotten their food within that same period of time. Food was okay but certainly not worth the price. In spite of the bad service, an automatic gratuity of 20 percent was applied to our tab.
pos	Great Spanish food and tapas
pos	Really enjoyed the seafood paella.
pos	Service it is good, environment ok prices accesible, food it not to bad only whatch out with the paella is to grasse. If I can score the kitchen I will give 85% service 95%  place and decorations 70%.
pos	Every Telefèric we've been to is great! Great food and drinks! A must for a date night.
pos	Gorgeous food!
pos	Food was great, bit different from the usual tapas with nice atmosphere and friendly service. Would go again next time we're in Barcelona
neu	It's a little like traveling in Spain, including the limited vegetarian options.
pos	Everything we tasted was absolutely delicious. Great service. Very comfortable outdoor seating. Highly recommended
pos	Enjoy the wonderful tapas, think your card
pos	Great tapas spot. Really yummy foods. Octopus. Iberico. Steaks. Greens. All good. And they seat ppl pretty quickly. Considering Covid. It’s really Covid friendly.
pos	Food, service just great. Can be on the prize side but the quality is up there. Croquetas de jamon and the grill octopus are some of my favorite tapas
neg	Except for the waiters, who were friendly and didn't charge us for some of the food we sent back to the kitchen because of how stale and awful it tasted, there's nothing great about this place. Would not visit again.
pos	Recommend octopus, tuna tarta and shrimp
pos	Perfect plan for memorial weekend! Sangria, ham, croquetas and paella. Everything was delicious, I will be ordering takeout more often
pos	Everything is soooo yummy!
neu	Good food except for the Paellas (greasy, almost no seafood, VERY disappointing) service was decent.
pos	Excellent spot for tapas; truly reminded me of Barcelona. All dishes were terrific and the drinks delicious. Do not pass on the octopus!
pos	Excellent service, interior, vibe, and the food is amazing. Everything we ordered was wonderful.
pos	First time trying it. Grabbed some appetizers (Octopus and Empanadas) and sangria. Everything was fresh and the service friendly. Wife and I will return.
pos	Perfect restaurant and service, I find the place well decorated and atmosphere very friendly and they serve the best drinks
pos	Excellent attention. Delicious food.
neg	It’s ok, if you want to follow the crowd. I came when it first opened and enjoyed. Unfortunately this visit - I thought food overpriced, service was not great. Music too loud, had to shout over it. Seriously music was so bad it ruined the experience. Won’t be back...
neu	This restaurant NEVER answers their phone. Pretty bad customer service. Food varies with every order
pos	Fantastic food taste and artful presentation. Very high Complements to the chef.. Well worth dining for the  experience.
pos	Every single thing we ordered from sangria to paella was the highest quality. Excellent service as well.
pos	Drinks and food very good. Ordered Sangria and tapas. Wonderful ambiance
pos	Amazing experience and lovely authentic Spanish food. Burning man Rum, a authentic creative author cocktail. The space It’s cozy and comfortable.
pos	This is such a cool spot! Even though it's a little pricey and the restaurant a bit loud, the atmosphere and the food were excellent and the cocktails were fun and delicious!
pos	Great spanish food. The meat paella is mind-blowing. I also recommend their patatas bravas.
neg	I went there yesterday for party of 2. When we check out, 20% of tips applied automatically, AND they also applied sales tax on the tips.  This is the second time I find out they applied sales tax on the tips with in one or two months.
pos	Amazing food and drinks, sangria was amazing and the paella like in spain, We definetly coming back, staff was friendly and kind. Highly recomend this place anytime.
pos	Love it. Great service.
pos	Super good! Luis is an awesome server!
pos	Tapas are so good here!
pos	This is one of my favorites places in Bay Area! The food is amazing, especially patatas bravas and taquitos de tuna. Sangria is pretty good too. Being at this place feels like being in real Barcelona
pos	My cousin and I came here for lunch. Their food are delicious.  I will definitely come back next time when I visit Palo Alto
pos	Everything was really very delicious, but if you like to eat lots your meal will end up being very costly. I'll definitely repeat but not an everyweek place for me.
neu	Was not worth the price. Food is average.
neg	Looks like pandemic really got their good chefs.  Over fried food with really disaster called paella
pos	Really great food! Delicious!  Very helpful and friendly service!
pos	Paellas are delicious but the real treat are the cocktails. Absolutely delicious.
pos	Taking few appetizers is my favorite way to have a light meal. Very friendly  helpful people work there :)
neg	Hands down worst Paella ever..... thoroughly disappointing food.
pos	Great tapas, great dishes, great paella, great service , friendly hostesses and wait staff. Great experience ! Will definitely go back !!
pos	Excellent service food is very good atmosphere in the restaurant is lively Good place for get together or party
pos	Pricy but food is interesting and delicious
pos	Best Spanish food in the Bay Area
pos	Top end Topas. Beautiful presentation of food and excellent service. Pretty good sangria as well. Good place for a special get together.
pos	We love Teleferic.
neg	Food is good, but what is "mandatory gratuity"?
pos	Great atmosphere, good food. A bit pricey.. worth it for special occasions...
pos	Great cocktails. Great food.  Only thing would be more vegetarian options
pos	Amazing food, Great ambience, and fantastic service! We will definitely be going again.
pos	Brings back memories of our time in Barcelona and Madrid. If you are looking for authentic Spanish food, beer, and wines, this is the place to go!
pos	Stellar food and stellar service. A delight. I can’t believe I didn’t know about this place already. A new favorite!
pos	Nice atmosphere and setting. Good food... Good service... I had a delicious octopus. It was a good experience!
pos	Some of the food was sublime but some of it was very mediocre.  I would have expected better given the price point.
neg	Beware if ordering pickup, my order had missing items and there’s no way to contact them on their website and never picked up the phone.
pos	Great food, service, and ambience. Will be back! Especially liked the sangria, cauliflower, pork belly, and french toast.
pos	Will definitely come again. Very nice food.
neg	Awful selection of beer . Tastes like Japanese beer. Snacks are expensive and super small. One star.
pos	Delicious tapas in a lively atmosphere. Date night or group worthy.
pos	Absolutely amazing experience! Great tapas, & the tomahawk steak was heavenly!
neg	This place has very worse customer service I had a order dinner for pickup I went after 45 minutes  they said stay outside. No one came to ask about your order…
pos	Nice presentation, friendly staff.

pos	Potatoes and jamon were so delicious! I came in the afternoon and had a light meal. The main dish seems to be great, so a good seat reservation is essential!
pos	Spanish restaurant located in Palo Alto, California, USA. As the name suggests, it specializes in Catalunya cuisine, but, like most, it has changed a lot to the American style.  The menu is mainly tapas, and there are foods that can be shared as a main dish. Ordered soup, some tapas, steak, etc. I ordered crab croquettes, but unusually, there is tuna sashimi on top of the croquettes. Crab is also a food that has a strong umami taste, but with suksong sashimi on it, it is at the level of umami + umami. It is also new because hot and cold food comes in at the same time. Everyone eats octopus, so I ordered it too. Potato puree with truffle oil and paprika powder made from crispy grilled octopus. It's a delicious combination just to read. Crispy + chewy texture and spicy + green gin taste. The main Iberico pork steak we ordered is called Buddha's Top Secret. Toughly grilled pork, sprinkled with coarse salt, grilled mushrooms, jamon, and fried shallots as a garnish. Although it is a pig + pork combination when combined with hamon, it has a good balance when combined with garnish. Paella is ordered as ink paella. It wasn't made by stir-frying with paella, but after making it, vegetables, shrimp, mushrooms, etc. were put on top of it to match it better.  When I went to Barcelona, ​​there were many unique dishes such as the birthplace of molecular cuisine, but I thought there were many tough recipes that revealed the taste of the raw ingredients, but this is similar to the latter.
pos	Very nice place inside, the bar is beautiful and the place is very cozy. will have to go back 
pos	Unique Spanish food is refined and delicious 
pos	Simply wonderful, excellent service, food as always delicious. I was very happy to know that there are two units, and one is close to my house, I will definitely come back. 
pos	Spanish restaurant in the mall within walking distance from Palo Alto station  Paella is a specialty 🥘  Crab croquettes is the most recommended  $ 50 per person- 
pos	Restaurant of excellent quality, very popular thanks to the goodness of the dishes and the perfect organization both inside the room furnished with care and personality and outside that despite the weather is not good, has heating bells that create a pleasant and comfortable warmth for those who choose to dine outdoors. The restaurant has very clean and comfortable bathrooms, the cost of lunch making the quality ratio is low but a lot depends on what you want to consume, I can say that I was very satisfied.
neg	I recommended you to some American friends to celebrate their anniversary (they had a reservation for two weeks) at your place. The surprise has been to ask them about the experience and tell me that they left very very disappointed. You put them on a table overlooking an emergency door next to the bathroom, with cleaning utensils propped up on the wall. Although they liked the food, they were horrified by the treatment and especially the table that you gave them. Of course they won't come back. You have made me look really bad. I will not recommend you again and I will scold Abel (Abel Rincón) for recommending a site like this. Very disappointed. I'll pass you a photo that my friends have sent me of the great views on their anniversary day. By the way the bill for two people was 350 dollars. Shameful.
pos	The restaurant is full of good, our restaurant is in Spain; the meals are very good; there are many people at dinner time, it is highly recommended to book in advance, there are only outdoor seats at 5:00 on the day.  Tha alchemist Asked the waiter if she wanted to drink sweets, one of the cups she recommended; after a long absence, it felt a bit strong. It tasted the most orange, the big ice hockey in the middle was a bit cute, and there was gold powder on it Pulpo Telefèric It should be a signature dish (an octopus foot is printed on the signboard). The octopus is very crispy on the surface but still tender in the middle. The mashed potato underneath has a truffle flavor and is delicious. Paella de Bogavante I do n’t know what the authentic Spanish risotto tastes but it ’s delicious, the seafood is enough, the lobster and shrimp are tender
neg	Upon arrival I asked for a table for two, a tall girl with black hair accommodated us at the last table At the end of the corridor, I don't understand why because there were many empty tables and more comfortable ones with heaters so I asked another girl to change us and so on did . The food was very good, we ordered several appetizers and a good paella...I loved my Ibiza Gin and tonic cocktail so much that my boyfriend also decided to have one....now I rate it one star for two reasons. The girl I mentioned at the beginning and for the 20% tip that is practically mandatory since it is included in the bill but it should be to the customer's taste. 
pos	There aren't many Spanish restaurants in the Bay Area, but I found it to be the most delicious I've ever visited. Especially the octopus dishes and squid ink paella were delicious. 
pos	Wow the food is amazing and the place is beautiful 
pos	Charmed! Does anyone know the name of the cheeses on the cheese board? 
pos	Excellent meal. Delicious paella. Spectacular octopus. Super recommend.

pos	Excellent restaurant, tapas and cocktails 
pos	An incredible experience ... 🥇 
pos	I loved 
neu	Got the Thai pop.  It was like pop corn chicken from most boba shops. Some pieces were good but some were mostly batter.  The sauce was too sweet for my taste & wish there were more fried basil to give it more flavor. It was very busy during the lunch time rush hour  and the staff tried to move things along as quickly as possible while being courteous. Willing to go back to try other item.
neu	If you are in the neighborhood looking for to-go, and like chicken karaage, don't mind some grease, you might like this place.   Or check out the rice dishes or Thai iced tea machine.  The quality of chicken is no worse than most places around here, and since Bonchon chain has gone down the drain, this may be the slightly better option (at R&R you don't get soy garlic or gochujang, you get toasted rice nori? Or sweet chili sauce on the side).  Several years ago, this place used to be a chicken place with a different name (Tony?we don't recall).  Now it's got a spiffy looking sign and clean cut look.  We didn't want rice, so we ordered the chicken a la carte option with a mix of wing, thighs, drumsticks, which tasted like bone-in chicken karaage and also tried the popcorn chicken, which was exactly like the taiwanese fried chicken at those bubble tea places, right down to the two skewers.  The bone in fried chicken smelled like your typical fresh fried chicken, overall tasted fresh, but was very greasy, oily.   They do give you fresh lime wedges that cut the grease a bit.  The fat, particularly in the chicken wings is 80% rendered, which given that NO place around here we have tried has yet to render properly (why?why?) we either fry ourselves and smell the lingering chickeny odor for days in our rental apartment while working from home, or  just settle for mostly rendered, and spit out pieces of rendered fat. (Yes, truly we have sunk to a new low)  The popcorn chicken was less greasy, but like other taiwanese fried chicken places, pieces were rather rubbery, fatty, and mostly fried batter pieces (Some people love this).  We got a mixed batch, some were pale, powdery, some were dark brown/black in color.  They package your chicken in vented eco-friendly containers.  Not closing the lids keeps chicken crispy.   The plastic bag accumulate lots of moisture, but guessing paper bags might leave grease spots in your car.  They are generous with the deep fried Thai basil, but maybe it's the season? There was no aroma or taste (normally you can smell the sharp herbal note of Thai basil).  Service is friendly, but store procedure could be improved.  Once you place your order on one of the two kiosks, an estimated wait time/txt msg when order is ready would be nice.  As it was, we waited outside, (there isn't really a waiting area or seating inside) hovering at the entryway, making sure we didn't miss our name being called from inside the store, while not blocking potential customers from entering.  Good to know: if you order a rice dish, they do carry the worst quality splintery chopsticks that a lot of silicon valley restaurants use (i am on a mission to eliminate these splintery cheapo chopsticks from restaurants everywhere!  Saving one tender mouth at a time!)
pos	We got Roost and Roast for lunch delivery. Everything showed up hot and fresh.  I decided to try their "Gai Yang" BBQ Chicken and the Roti and Curry. I thought both were delicious. The BBQ chicken had a delicious lightly sweet marinade on it with a little sauce on the side. It was well cooked, tender enough and well balanced. It was served over rice with some cucumbers and was definitely a hearty plate of food. I only wished I had a little more sauce.  I also tried the Roti and Curry. I did not find the curry to be watery. It had a nice mild flavor and coated the roti nicely. It was the perfect amount for the amount of roti.  I would definitely eat here again and I would definitely go for the BBQ chicken a second time.
neu	Yikes, this plaza's parking lot is hot garbage on a weekend afternoon. My review of this place isn't affected by that, but just reader beware if you plan to go.  Roost and Roast sounded like my perfect place to check out. I like chicken. I like fried chicken. Easy decision to go.  I ordered: - Hat Yai Fried Chicken Meal - Roti and Curry - Popcorn Chicken  They surprisingly did not have khao mun gai/hainanese chicken. No biggie.  The fried chicken had an excellent crunch and the chicken was very moist, but the flavor was extremely light and def needed the sweet chili sauce on the side. If it had just a touch more seasoning/salt, it would have been great. The meal comes with jasmine rice (which was cooked fantastically) and cucumber slices to cut through the oil. 4/5  The roti and curry was alright. The roti wasn't as light and thin as I'm used to having it, but the curry sauce was so very light. It definitely leaned more towards the coconut milk flavor than the curry flavor. 2/5  The popcorn chicken didn't have a distinct smell or flavor. Like the fried chicken, it could have used more seasoning, whether on the outside after frying or on the inside while marinating. The portion for this was extremely generous and the fried Thai basil definitely helped, but this too needed to be eaten with sweet chili. 3/5  Dining tables can be hard to get, so be prepared to eat in your car or enjoy it at home. If you're lucky, you can grab a table, but they're all shared between the other restaurants there.
pos	Fried chicken was really good. Very crispy with the right amount of seasoning. I’m really happy that a Thai fried chicken place opened up around here. The style is unique and pairs really well with some rice and papaya salad. The sauces could use more fish sauce and chilies and less sugar. I get it that they’re trying to appeal to a general audience but give us options to kick up the fire. Pad Thai and other noodles were ok, too sweet for my tastes.  Just come here for the fried chicken, you’ll be a happy camper.
pos	Absolutely delicious Asian food. Ordered delivery using ezcater and this is one of the best restaurants we've used. Delivered on time, good food portions at a reasonable price.  Pad Krapow Moo (Pork) [Pork stir-fry with Thai basil served over rice, topped with a fried egg and served alongside fresh cucumber, mint and lime wedge] was fantastic with a lovely spice level to round out the flavor profile.
neg	Went to Roost & Roast a few nights ago and ordered the lemongrass chicken and the papaya salad for takeout. I was a bit underwhelmed by the food and selection. The chicken was greasy and not super appetizing or yummy - I would say it was just ok. The papaya salad was ok but has a ton of cilantro - the cilantro flavor is a bit overpowering. All in all, I prefer Asian Box in Town & Country for Asian street food.
pos	Always a satisfying chicken dinner. I usually get the BBQ or lemongrass chicken with salad on the side and the toasted rice sauce. Unique take on Thai (and chicken) that you don’t find elsewhere.
neu	Located in a nice, busy strip mall in Palo Alto. Ordered the pop corn chicken entree and found it to be non-greasy (yay!) but lacking in flavor. Even the dipping sauce was syrupy sweet even though we ordered the toasted rice sauce (vs the sweet chili option).
pos	So good, such a welcome addition to T&C! We had the BBQ chicken, roti with curry and papaya salad with a thai iced tea - all were excellent. Will be back often!
pos	Hatyai fried chicken was flavorful and fresh - the amount of seasoning was perfect (not too much, some salt, pepper, maybe garlic?). The watermelon lemonade was very refreshing and the staff were really helpful. They let us try both sauces for the chicken too!  The chicken dipping sauces were both tasty but a bit too sweet, and the portion of white rice on the side was a lot. I would definitely come back though, it's great to have a good Thai option in this area!
pos	We love your chicken!  Light, crunchy, not too oily, and perfectly seasoned.  The wide variety of dishes including Pad Thai, salads, and multiple types of friend chicken are a perfect fit for our family.  So glad we found this place, it’s destined to become one of our favorites.
pos	Finally got to try this place after seeing it mentioned in the Six Fifty/Peninsula Foodist newsletter. YUM!  I'm not sure what the wait time is like if you order at the counter. I've been tending to opt for online ordering these days just to skip waits and lines, and everything was ready to go and hot when I arrived. I hadn't been sure about the seating situation so hadn't planned to necessarily stick around and eat, but there were 4-5 outdoor tables so we sat down and went to town!  We got the fried chicken and BBQ chicken. The fried chicken was definitely good if that's what you're in the mood for, but if I'm being honest, the BBQ chicken was a wonderful surprise and the thing I would order if I came back again. SO moist and flavorful - HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  The prices are a tad high, but hey, it's Palo Alto. Great fast casual. We also got the Thai iced tea and watermelon lemonade. Both were good, but I preferred the latter a bit. I'll be back.
pos	I was trying to decide what to take home for dinner when this place caught my eye. I ended up ordering the BBQ chicken over rice (with tamarind sauce) and I was so impressed at how delicious it was! The chicken is moist and flavorful, and and I am definitely planning to come back to try the rest of their menu. My one small note on take-out preparation though, is that I think they should separate out the fried onion pieces into a little container so the customer can put them on. The onion pieces got kinda soggy from the heat and sauce of the chicken on the ride home. But still 5/5, that’s a really small nitpick.
pos	Have come here quite a few times since it opened, and every time it’s been excellent! I usually get the popcorn chicken but have also tried the pineapple fried rice and a few other dishes. Popcorn chicken is crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and the sauces are yuuuuuuummy! The pineapple rice is wonderfully seasoned and has a lot of depth. All around delicious, with a very friendly staff.
pos	Very tasty food executed well.  Friendly staff and super clean store make this restaurant even more appealing.  As another review mentioned, there is a sweetness to the roti and curry, but I personally enjoyed that about it.  The papaya salad is refreshing and seasoned very well.  The fried chicken items are all very crispy, tender, juicy, and overall delicious.  Kudos to this restaurant and their staff!  I will be a repeat customer :)
pos	I love their Hat Yai Fried! It comes with 3 pieces of bone-in fried chicken, fried onions and basil, rice, lime, and a sweet chili dipping sauce. The chicken is not too oily, has a crispy exterior and juicy interior, and is seasoned to perfection. I can’t wait to order it again!
pos	Went in to order and tore into my meal as soon as I got it, so everything was super fresh and hot. The hat yai  chicken was crispy and juicy and tender and perfectly cooked. Papaya salad was delightfully spicy, but the roti and curry was too sweet for my taste. Service was quick and pleasant.
pos	Great food! Friendly, helpful staff. Reasonable prices for the area. Food is lite, not oily or greasy. This will replace another local spot in our regular rotation for sure! Great addition to the town and country food options, we're always excited for new food spots and this one didn't disappoint.  Thai Pop: tasty, entree was reasonable portion. Pad Thai: best in the area, we've tried many many places. Better than Tommy and Lotus. Fried rice: also very good, not quite as flavorful as Tommy but way less oily. Roti & Curry: good, not zareens good but still good. Probably wouldn't get it regularly but glad we tried it, no regrets.  We'll be back! Tough location (even belcampo couldn't survive in that space!) So fingers crossed the community embraces it, hope they stick around.
neg	Your fried chicken is indelibly salty, it is beyond the matter of preference in my humble opinion. Maybe too long in the brine, please check the taste. If not for this critical flaw, the food could have earned 5 star
neu	TL;DR: if you want roti, don't get the side. It's only one piece of roti, and they might forget to add it.  Good chicken, but a bit expensive. We ordered two extra sides of roti and curry ($3.50 each) for our chicken meals, but we only received one side. The one side only consisted of one piece of roti. We were a bit disappointed to have paid $7 extra for the one roti we received.
neu	Got the regular Taiwanese friend chicken and papaya salad. Both were flavorless and had old ingredients
neu	Lower the prices for students its kinda expensive 9$ + tax for the pineapple fried rice also most of the food here too. The Fried rice here is pretty good tho
pos	Delicious fried chicken! Their Thai milk tea was also great.
pos	Some of the best chicken around… crispy and flavorful skin with tender, juicy meat. Will definitely be coming back!
neu	Popcorn chicken was dry and stale.
pos	Good food!
pos	Stopped for a quick bite to go. I like that they have vegetarian and gluten-free options. I placed my order at the counter, was given a buzzer and waited outside for it to buzz. Once it did, I went to the other side of the restaurant to pick up.  I ordered the Impossible Burger with gluten free bread and a lemonade. The lemonade was tart but not sweet enough for my liking. I wasn’t a fan of the gluten free bread. It normally comes with egg bread. The impossible burger was overcooked if that makes sense for a vegan patty but with ketchup it was okay.
pos	Grabbed some burgers here. Both the California & Kimchi burgers were great. One of the burgers was a bit over cooked, but the flavors were great. The Kimchi burger was better than I expected, nice texture & flavors that had a hint of spice. The garlic fries very pretty good, too. Plenty of seating outdoors & inside.  Edit: went back another time, the flavors were still good. However, there is a theme of burgers being cooked well done..
pos	Variety selection of burgers and they can substitute any burgers with veggie patty which is great for vegetarians. Surprisingly they have tacos and avocado taco is great option for vegetarians. Their onion rings were ok and tomato soup was good. Nice ambiance.
pos	Had a late lunch here on a Saturday. Lots of outdoor tables, which majority of them were filled with people. We did find an open table and requested to have the table be cleaned. A staff came right away and wiped down the bench and table for us. The line waiting to order wasn't too long. I had my usual, the Ahi Sandwich, which tasted great, with fresh cut fries, and ice tea. Perfect for the sunny afternoon.
neu	Surprisingly popular place given how mediocre the food is. The chicken fingers were at least hot but the burger was precooked, overcooked, dry and cold. Generous 3 stars since the kid liked the chicken. Fries were also cold.
pos	My coworker recommended this place to me. My husband and I ordered Wisconsin burger, citrus & avocado salad and sweet corn.  Salad was ok but the burger and the corn were soooo good.  The sweet corn tasted so much better than the ones we had in New York before. The burger was a perfect combination of the bun,soft inside but crispy outside, and the crispy not too salty bacon and the mushroom. Very flavorful. We love it.
pos	Surely different taste from popular burger brands. Local ingredients and local folks. I want to visit again if I pass by again
pos	Really friendly service and I'm glad that there's one here at Palo Alto fresh burgers and they got some of the best garlic fries ever for the price! They also have seasonal specials such as the lobster roll which can get very pricey but it's something that doesn't come around often! Service was really great and they also point out the specials as well as some other recommendations!
neg	Stopped by Gott's Roadhouse to get dinner with my family after a day in San Francisco. Ordered two Western Blue Burgers, a Wisconsin Burger, onion rings, and garlic fries which took 45 minutes to make since they got our order wrong twice.. The burgers were decent, the fries were okay, and the onion rings were good. Despite the wrong orders and the long wait we were not given a good apology. I dont think we'll stop by again anytime soon.
pos	It's a great burger. The side dishes (fries, mostly) are also excellent. I also commend adding the option to substitute the bun for lettuce wrap. Really great. Unfortunately it does come with a cost. $15 for a burger (nothing else) is just too much. But, yes, I will come back at some point.
neg	I normally would never send back food but it came out stone cold. They did offer to remake it for us which we were pleased about but unfortunately we weren’t too impressed with the second round either. I got the Baja tacos with cheese fries and my husband got the cheeseburger. All in all I think there are much better options in the area for the same kind of food (and cheaper). Jeffery’s is right down the street and their burgers and fries are amazing!
pos	Busy busy busy. To me that's good! Rather have to wait for good food than rush for mediocre food. And yes the food was good. My wife had the fish tacos, out should I say fish taco. I came to get rescue and ate 1. Tasty! I had the California chicken sandwich. Chicken breast, not over cooked, toppings fresh also good. Onion rings flavored enough didn't need ketchup, but the hot sauce oh boy the hot sauce! Little sweet but very tasty. I loved it. He's right behind you.
neg	This review is long overdue (like 2 years!), so Gotts might have improved, but I never had the desire to go back & check. In my experience, this restaurant was mediocre and overhyped. There were long lines, limited seating, overpriced foods, and average flavors. I've had far better vegetarian burgers for way less. And the cheese fries--how do you get cheese fries wrong?!
pos	Great burgers. Lots of choices, new items on menu all the time. They tend too cook it med rare so if your not cool with seeing very pink inside the patties tell them when ordering. Price is a lil high for a burger spot but good food ain't cheap.
neu	The burgers are regular thick burgers. They taste fine and there are really no surprises to what you get. In my opinion the burgers here are a little bland and small, always leaving you hungry if you get a regular meal but especially if you only get a burger. This is kind of disappointing to me considering the price of these burgers.
pos	We really loved this place. I have to admit that the service wasn't the best. Every time we asked someone a question, they  seemed pretty annoyed. It was our first time there so I don't know if that's usual. The food though was very good. Everything we ordered was delicious and we had no complaints. There wasn't any directional signage to indicate what to do with our trash so that was another question but we didn't throw away much. I highly recommend this place for an afternoon out as they have outdoor and covered seating. It's a bit pricey though so be aware of that. The teriyaki chicken sandwich and the turkey burgers come highly recommended as well as the citrus avocado salad which is what I had. Good stuff.
pos	Very delicious charbroiled burgers here! Fries were super fresh and the milkshakes are the most flavorful milkshakes I’ve ever had in my life! It is pricey here but its worth it if you are looking for something fresh and flavorful. Staff is also super friendly and awesome. Cannot wait to come back!
pos	Go to place. Beer. Burger. Ice Cream. Very good for family. My son is a picky eater and never says no to anything on kids menu. They get their Avocado burger perfect. 🙌🙌
pos	We've had their food many times, at a few of their locations. I'd say it ranges from good to very good. My favorite dishes are the Ahi Burger, Vietnamese Salad, and Western Bacon Blue Ring Burger. My wife also really likes the Crispy Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich.
neg	I've generally had good experiences at Gott's and been many times, but recently ordered pick-up and my burger was basically raw. The website says they cook them medium well and it's never been a problem, but I'm currently pregnant and was depending on that. Instead, I bit into the burger and it was pink, and when I cut into it further it was clearly not cooked (almost looked like it came straight out of the fridge with brown on the outside.
neg	First impressions: dude at the cashier screaming “NEXT!”. Everyone working here seems like they’re holding a grudge against this place.  Food impressions: cold depressing Hot dog. Like 7-11 has better meat than there. Its garbage. Fries also were lower quality than mcdonalds. Way overpriced.  Verdict: never coming back here
pos	We just finished walking around the Stanford campus and we were super hungry and wanted a burger. This place really hit the spot! The bacon cheeseburger with blue cheese was really in the top 10 burgers I have ever had! The char was so flavorful. I highly recommend that you try this place! Nice outfdoor dining area.
pos	I like the food + cool price My friend got late order for me, but maybe we are not so good or maybe Gott forgot to make the fries garlic ;-; kind sad, left this review just wish all the fries garlic in the world, I like fries but I love garlic ones
neg	Made me wait 5 minutes for a ridiculous 9.00 shake. Save your money and go to jack on the box for the same thing twice the size and half as price
pos	Love this place! Been coming here with my boyfriend since we discovered it 1 year ago. The impossible burger (vegetarian) is a MUST! He always gets the double cheeseburger its HUGE! The beer and milkshakes are the best combo with the burgers! Highly recommend. See you again soon Gott's
pos	Excellent outlet of this premium burger chain. The dining area is spacious, and there is outdoor seating available too. The food is super tasty and well prepared. I love their garlic fries, and very much enjoyed their California burger on my most recent visit. They also do some specials - we had a nice gazpacho and corn on the cob.
pos	They offered  a lettuce wrap option to all sandwiches, That was nice but... the just put it between  2 chunks of iceberg lettuce . Onion rings great.
neu	There is always a line so I figured it has to be really good. And maybe because I have such high expectations, I was a bit disappointed. I think the ahi tuna and the  coleslaw was a very good combination, but I really don't like the bun. It's way too soft and spongy. Tuna is soft to begin with and matching with this soft bun is just missing the texture. Fries are OK, I've had better. Corn with the Parmesan cheese is a good change from the typical butter.
neu	This place was my first introduction to the Impossible Burger which I read so much about. And it did not disappoint! I also had their Mexican street corn, sweet potato fries, and mint shake... all of which were excellent.  However, like many of the other reviewers, I feel they got very greedy. They jacked up their prices like crazy and the portions seemed to get smaller/ less tasty every time I visited.  I hope they can improve these point to win back their customers. Otherwise hard to justify the hellish parking around here!
pos	Came here for brunch lots on the menu to choose from so we had the Mahi Mahi taco, Kimchee burger (got a kick not too spicy) and Niman's Frankfurter and a side of chili cheese fries yummy!!! And it was a nice enough day to sit outside if u wanted too!!
pos	Really good hamburgers I am a In&Out fan always and forever lol and this place has  replaced my favorite place if Im far away from my fav place! As you can see is set for eating outside and has a electric heater to warm in cold days for me this is a plus!!
neu	Burger is fine but too expensive. You can get same burger at other place with less than $10 easy. Will be back if they have combo within $15.
neu	Easy to order. Meat was pink. They don't ask how you would like it, unless you tell them. Fries were good. For tables, you just kind of sit anywhere so sometimes if its busy you might have to wait for a table even when you got your food.
pos	I'm a fan of the original, so I was surprised when I found a Gott's near the Stanford campus. Delicious food as usual, although I didn't see elote on the menu, but maybe it's a seasonal item.
pos	Pleasant, popular burger spot located in an outdoor plaza with ample seating.  However it's popularity the Saturday we visited with family was a bit busy, but that is definitely telling of it's popularity.  Food was good and the person taking our order made sure that once dietary restrictions were mentioned, that our food was safe from allergens.  Much appreciated and entire staff was very friendly.
pos	Yummy and fast order. I tried their Ahi burger and it didn’t let me down
neg	I ordered lettuce wrap ehy gave me the egg bun？？？
pos	Had the green chile cheeseburger and it was a 9/10! The buns were really fluffy and toasted, and the patty was juicy. I couldnt taste too much of the chiles but the overall texture and mouth feel were those of a good burger!
pos	Delicious food with decent prices. We got the single and double cheeseburger. Fried cauliflower was out of this world. Wish we would have gotten the dipped cones when we saw them served.
pos	Pretty good burger and fries here. Big menu with plenty of options for different burger flavors along with other available dishes. Dessert seemed to be soft serve cones. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Would and will return here for more food in the future.
pos	The burgers here are amazing! Very juicy and great portions. The fish tacos are great! Would go back to get the seared ahi Great for families and casual dining.
neg	Today at Gott’s was a disappointment. The ahi tacos looked “sickly” and the chipotle sauce wasn’t evident. The burger’s cheese wasn’t fully melted. It was still cold.
neg	Over-priced and over-hyped! Don’t expect a “quick meal” from this place.  Went here based on reviews and proximity after a Stanford football game. The place wasn’t busy, yet it took nearly 20 mins for our food order to be called; meanwhile friends and I had already finished our pints of beer. When the food arrived, my expectations were sadly not met with an over priced burger that was substantially underwhelming.  I’ll take McDonald’s next time.
pos	Burgers are solid, fries are OK. Service is pretty good. Convenient location from campus and easily accessible by the Stanford Marguerite shuttles.
neu	The California burger isn’t bad, but this spot is basically fast food except it takes 20 minutes instead of 2 and costs $15 instead of 5. Welcome to Palo Alto…
pos	Yummy food, great location. Garlic fried are great. Cheese burger is great also. However, too many people so service is a bit slow.
pos	Great food and very cool place to eat. Felt very comfortable here with races on the TV and oldies on the radio. Everything we had to eat was excellent
pos	Great food. Especially the ahi poke crispy tacos. Sometimes a long wait. They have beer/wine/shakes to drink, and nice outdoor seating.
pos	Impossible burger is truly impossible! I have no idea how they achieved such a taste without the use of any meat!? It is a vegan burger that is better than any juicy/fatty fast-food burger!
pos	Super tasty and fresh. Chicken teriyaki sandwich was more Bahn Mi inspired than teriyaki but great all the same.
neu	Burger was over cooked and the toppings were bland tasting on my Bacon Western Burger. Anything with Bacon should have more flavor for a $15 burger!
pos	Ahi Burger. Wasn't spicy like what people have previously mentioned. Was tasty but wasn't as flavorful as I expected. The other people I was with ordered the hamburger and hot dog which was delicious, I had to try a bite (get that of you go!)
pos	Had to come to the Bay area for a meeting and found this place... Read some pretty scathing reviews but decided to try anyway. It was GOOD. Was it the best burger ever? No. But was it solid? You betcha. And a respectable special sauce (very important to me personally). Fries were hot and crispy. Beer was cold. But I have to give a special mention to the middle age guy with glasses manning the counter: really friendly, welcoming, offers a cup with ice for water with a lime or lemon slice if you'd like. Truly nice guy who gives a great impression on walking through the door. Thanks, Gott's! I'll stop by again if I'm in town 👍🏼
pos	We got some burgers and fries here as well as a couple of malted milkshakes. The burger was ok and the shakes were good. We should have ordered a smaller size shake as it was all pretty filling even though we shared. The fries were not as good as I hoped for this kind of establishment.  We sat at the outside seating on a rainy December evening and it was dry and warm with overhead heating and reasonable lighting.
pos	Yummy fancy burgers. Lots of teens from Paly. Made my wife reminisce about how noisy she was when she was their age... 😄.
pos	Delicious burgers and drinks! Appreciate the friendly service. On the pricy side though. Small burger for about $12. Blue bottle coffee for about $5.
pos	Love their messy burgers. Great selection of choices (basic cheeseburger or with lots of different toppings). Their fries are excellent and have a good selection of alcoholic drinks. Prices are a little high, but excellent service.
neg	No where near the SF Gotts from a food perspective. Burger was over done tacos have no tuna in them. Only positive is location close to the stadium.
neg	Poor and continues to get poorer. Rather go to shake shack and wait. Despite no line at 3:30 PM on a Saturday all the food is still pre made...COLD onion rings. Great location and atmosphere but I can no longer subject myself to the poor food.
neg	I ordered a cheese burger. They never asked how I wanted the meat cooked. I had to tell them that I wanted the meat to be medium well. The burger came in pink. It was rare, barely grilled. When I complained, the response was, "I'll let the cook know." The burger didn't taste good at all. The bread wasn't fresh, and the fries were oily. I didn't like the food, nor the service. In&out surpasses it by far.
pos	Delicious! We love the options, food is always spot on, and the price point is great. Avacado tacos were perfect, brussel sprouts are always a hit, the garlic fries are flavorful, and the obligatory ahi burger is a must have on each visit.
neu	First time back in a year, and unfortunately disappointed as I remember this place being really good. The burger was very small, barely filling for an adult, and while it was mentioned on signs that the burger is cooked medium well, mine was well done. 3 stars simply because of my memory of this place being good.
pos	Food is good but it's been sort of slow coming to you. Pandemic has made it even longer wait. If your starving and need  food fast this is not for you. If you don't mind waiting you should be happy. Also the food hasn't come out piping hot on a consistent basis during the pandemic. If you order any carbonated drink make sure it is the right one. (Diet vs regular) and mixture ratio.
pos	This place did not disappoint! My California burger was delicious! It is a bit pricey but it's much better than fast food.
pos	I've been coming since they opened and it's always been a great place for a real or impossible burger, beer, fish taco, aches great sweet potato fries
pos	I always enjoyed going here. This time I ordered the hotdog, its casing was hard and chewy though.
pos	Good quality food, but poor service and execution for the price point. $14 burger should come with speedy service and great customer service. Staff seems overwhelmed and more focused on their conversations then focusing on the customer. Not to mention a 10-15 minute wait (arrived after lunch rush). Skip the line and do DoorDash.
neu	The burgers are pretty good. But I think they should be very good.
pos	Fast service even tho it was a busy day. Great bacon cheese burger. Friends both had the avocado tacos which they really enjoyed
pos	Great spot in Town and country village. Tons of seating outdoors on the patio with the smell of barbeque meat in the air. Service was super fast and the burgers were moist and delicious. Garlic fries were a 5/10
pos	Delicious!!!good service, garlic fries were a bit cold , fish&chips was very nicely done& wasn't greasy,  californian buger was so good ,it got a little messy with the fried egg but must try,& LOVED the sweet potato fries & the soft serve is to die for,so creamy with the perfect sweetness ,we had it dipped with almonds..so yummy, will come back to try other menu items.
neu	The wait for the food was quite long, even though the restaurant was pretty empty. The buns were cold and chili cheese fries were very soggy. The California burger and garlic fries tasted decent but the kimchi burger was bland despite promising lots of flavor in the menu description. The food is overpriced for the experience.
pos	Excellent burgers cooked medium well (not well done), great fries, and Ballast Point Sculpin on tap. Loved it!
neg	Vegetarians beware! They’ll probably put meat in your order.  We specifically asked for a “Wisconsin without bacon” and on the bill it specifically says no bacon and yet after a few bites we find bacon in it! We brought this up with the person handling the delivery desk, they were extremely nice about it and even though I was very angry given we don’t eat meat I figured no point in shouting at them now and it was just an honest mistake. They gave us a replacement burger and said they would refund the money, they pretended to refund but did not really. Their food is pretty epic but this experience is something that will never allow me to eat there again!
pos	One of my favorite places to go! I come here all the time whenever I'm in the area (or to the Ferry Building one if I'm in the city), and Gott's never disappoints. I love their fish tacos and their chicken sandwiches. I know this is a burger place, but seriously, they know how to make everything well! I also order a TON of fries (both regular and sweet potato) because they are some of the best I've ever had. The only thing that bothers me about Gott's is that their portions are pretty small...whenever I order the tacos, I usually get two orders because one order is just not enough. This ends up being pretty expensive, but it's worth it! I definitely recommend coming here; it is a must if you are in the area!
neu	Came in around 6ish on a Friday and the line was fairly long but didn't take that long to move through. We ordered a bacon cheeseburger, a California burger with a gluten free bun, cheese fries, a water, a beer, and a glass of wine for $66. Lemme just start by saying im glad they automatically ask if your gluten free request is due to allergies or preferences, and they have NAILED the gluten free bun. It's soft and durable without toasting which is just like very impressive for a GF bun. The rest of the California burger was pretty okay. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything spectacular and kinda small for a $15 burger. My partner said that he didn't get any bacon on his bacon cheeseburger, and the menu says that the cheese sauce for the fries is "made with jalapeños and onions" but didn't taste like jalapeños, and had like 4 green onions on them. I guess, if someone else wanted to eat here, I'd be willing to return & try a different burger since the GF bun was on point but idk if its just me but, this place seems way over priced. 🤷‍♀️ I wouldn't come back on my own or recommend it for anything other than the GF bun.
pos	Quite simply, this is one of the best burger eateries anywhere. No matter what. You must get a burger from here. I highly recommend the Wisconsin. And if you’re into it, the Ahi is really good too.
neu	The food here is solid. The kimchi burger is absolutely worth getting, they've got all the beer you need, the frosé is awesome, and the kids' corn dogs are on point.  The staff is friendly and helpful. The prices are a hair steep but it's Palo Alto so what do you want.  On its face this is an obvious four or five stars for a Google review. So why three?  We've placed three orders here, and they just cannot manage to get them right. We're a family of four so it's not like the law of large numbers is at work.  First order: our kiddo wants lettuce and onions on her kids' cheeseburger. It's an alteration of a menu item but an easy one, and it prints on the receipt. Cheeseburger comes out, no toppings. We ask for toppings (hey everyone makes mistakes), wait five minutes at the bar, ask again. By the time the veggies show up all the food is cold.  Second order: we wait 40 minutes for food. We go and check, it's been waiting and is cold. "Oh, I guess the buzzer didn't buzz, our bad." They graciously remake the food...  Third order: the kids' cheeseburger has been converted to a double no-cheese burger, though they do keep the veggies. It's a tasty burger but dry, and tbh not what we ordered.  To their credit, they are willing to fix mistakes, and they keep a smile on while they're doing it. But this is not rocket science.  I like the food but eating here is frustrating.
pos	Best chicken burger I’ve ever had. Best garlic fries I’ve ever had... best shake around too, why not go ahead and say that too. I love this place a lot, the staff are great and the food is killer. Every time I’m nearby I go. Highly recommend you snag a fried chicken sandwich and some of their finest garlic fries yo.
pos	I really enjoyed this place. Food well prepared well! Nice drink choices as well choices! Would've gave 5 stars but not all of the ice cream was working. Friendly staff!
neg	Thinly sliced bacon. Bland burger. Soggy grease filled onion rings and bland fries.  Also while I was there, they forgot my fries and while ease dropping on other orders while waiting, they forgot items to two other customers.  Overrated burger joint.
pos	Salad was sooo good. Pricey for a burger joint. Okay atmosphere, with plenty of Stanford Sweatshirt wearing people and big screen showing sports events.
pos	Delicious burgers and sandwiches. You have to try the fried brussel sprouts
pos	Another review - where we were too hungry and forgot to take pics.  Nice, diner style dining. Casual family friendly place where you can grab a burger or two and maybe chicken strips.  Burger was cooked just right, juicy and dressed well. Chicken strips were bland though, and a bit dry (maybe frozen before fried?)  They have a great special sauce that makes anything taste great - and you can find it in a bottle at your local grocery store.  Good place for a quick bite
pos	Onion ring is really great, the burger patty is sometimes too much burn
pos	Amazing burger place with open area for sitting. Napa location is terrific though. But the experience is unbeatable.
neu	Food was good.  Service was good.  All around not a bad lunch spot just a little pricey.   Everything is a la carte so no Real Deals on combos or anything. My hamburger which was good was 15 bucks and Fries were another five bucks so all-in-all for hamburger and fries out the door you talking 23 bucks I think it was with tax and everything else. Like I say not a bad one spot just kind of expensive for what you get.
neu	Food is a bit overrated for the price and the service staff isn't the most welcoming bunch of folks.
pos	This is one of the best hamburger places in the Bay Area. There food is consistently good with great service. The place is filled with people to eat in the restaurant and take out.
pos	Amazing burgers.  Great topins.  Kid friendly environment.  Good wine selection.
pos	Wasn't disappointed as their Napa location was my first encounter. Kimchi burger is my fav
pos	Best burgers on the peninsula. Super tasty, good quality, but not overly fancy. Thin burgers so there's always a good ratio of toppings to burger (but not too thin!). Excellent fries. Really yummy shakes. Highly recommend! Way exceeds famous fast food places like In n Out and Shake Shack. This is way way better and so delicious. They have the Impossible burger as well.
pos	The burger is big, the meat is thick, the vegetables are sweet, and it is better than the inn-out.
neg	Everything was bad , I don’t even know what els to say. I liked the other location better , the burger was not as good and dry . They messed up my order so bad and made it complicated and when I go home I found my double is only single. I asked for 2 ice cream they give me one then I had to ask for the second… I talked the manager he said I will talk to them so they don’t do it again. I am never going back.
neg	Garbage place. Do not eat here. The waiters are awful and it took over 30 minutes to get a simple milk shake while they were relatively empty.
pos	Gott’s has an Americana hamburger joint atmosphere that is sure to draw you in, and want to relive the ‘good ole days’. They have a wide variety of burgers on the menu that all looked good, and after having the western bacon and blue burger I can say that it is very tasty. The garlic fries were good as well and the service was prompt and friendly. The only reason I am giving the review 4 stars is because of the prices. A burger, fries and tap water set me back $20, which does not hark back to the golden years when a hamburger was a quick and very affordable option.
pos	Great place to eat. They make a mean burger 🍔
pos	Fun location but really pricey. Good food, good ice cream, ok burgers, with great, fresh salads. Poke and ahi tuna tacos need more tuna and less filler to taste better. Good local haunt and excellent outdoor setup.
pos	I love this place! The burgers are delicious and they have all the Bay Area staple drinks. There is plenty of seating inside, but there's also a lovely outdoor seating area. The ketchup here - Sir Kensington - is absolutely scrumptious.  My biggest complaint is the pricing. A burger, fries, and drink can easily come to $25/person.
pos	We've been here a couple of times recently. The food is quick to come out and the Impossible burger is my preferred option. It's pleasant to sit outside under the marquee if the day's not too hot.
pos	This may well be the best burger joint in Palo Alto! Consistently good food, wide variety of burgers and fast service. Their Ahi tuna burger is superb and so are their sweet potato fries. Definitely a Sunday lunchtime staple. Highly recommended!
pos	Quick serve restaurant with outdoor seating. Lots of heaters so even in the winter you are warm. Ordered the Impossible burger, garlic fries, and onion rings. Easily the best onion rings I've had in a long time - especially from a "fast food" style restaurant. Always a busy place but quick service.
pos	Great burgers. Probably the best in Palo Alto.
neg	Been here many times, and last visit in May was awful. Food order was wrong and a very long wait. No apologies from the staff, and longer wait for order to be made correctly. This was not a special order, so the expectation was not to wait another 30 minutes.  Will not be going back. Other burger places are equal if not better, without the long wait.
pos	If you're jonesing for a burger, you can't go wrong here. My first Gott's burger was in Napa and this largely squares with that memory. For people with gluten intolerance, I recommend this place as their staff seems properly trained and they have gluten free buns. Their pandemic order and checkout system works well.
pos	Delicious, healthy burgers with Gluten free options! The fries are delicious. Really, anything in the menu is good.
neg	Used to be great, but they've pulled a bait and switch on Doordash, They used to sell 750ml bottles of wine, but at some point they cut it to 375ml and have kept the same price. Absolutely horrible. How on earth is it ok to charge $42 for 375ml of wine. Shameful cash grab.
pos	Food was really good and the onion rings was yummy
pos	1st time here. Came with a friend.   I had the Citrus & Avocado Chop.  It was so good. Love the cilantro-pumpkin seed dressing. I will definitely come back here.
pos	This would have been a 3 star review if not for speedy response via email from the managment of Gott's. Thank you for your professionalism and business ethic.  I am from out of town and this restaurant was recommended to me for a popular burger joint. We ordered three different burgers and there were mistakes on all three of them. To top it off our fries were cold and limp.  The burgers were not the most expensive I've ever purchased, but at about $12.00 you should be able to get the cheese and onions you order.  Our order was to go so I had to email the restaurant after the fact. I chalked it up to some lack of employee training and continuity.  I would not spend this much time on a review if it wasn't for the fact that the burgers were pretty damn tasty. They use clean meats and locally sources ingredients.  I'm looking forward to giving them another try. You should too.
pos	Omg! I love Gotts! Real food! Great burgers d fries.
neg	I ordered the Western burger. The hamburger was cold, the bread overwhelmed the burger and was slathered with mayo. Although the hamburger was suppose to include broiled mushrooms and bbq sauce the dab of bbq was barely there. I ordered the sweet potato fries with the special ranch dressing too. The fries were cold and there was no sauce.  Mind you I ordered at the restaurant and waited 20min in the cold for my order and only live 10min away thos was a huge disappointment.  Should've gone to Clark's burger like I was going to.
pos	A more upscale hamburger/salad joint than your average place.  Their burgers are cooked over a flame, which you can taste, and they add toppings to them to make them a little more interesting.  Their salads and shakes appear to be a hit too, but I kept to their burgers.
pos	It's a tasty burger, but it's not"cheap". Many people say it's better than In N Out,  but it's not fair to compare In N Out to a burger that's 4x more expensive than in and out.  I had a Texas burger.  The patty was cooked to perfection, jalapenos had a small kick to them and I added on sweet potato fries as my side along with a shake.  Be ready to pay $15-$20/ person depending what you get.
neu	I should have gotten something different.  I got the Wisconsin Burger and was disappointed in the fact that there was no produce on it at all. I should have read the description closer.  Will be back because there are good options and Gotts usually comes through.  Just not this time
pos	This was a great place for burgers, good selection of drinks and great fries. Gotta try the impossible burger! It's plant based meatless burger. I felt like I ate a real cheese burger. It was amazing. I liked it better than their chili burger (which was also great!!). I was super wary about it but I am solid on that meatless burger. The sweet potato fries and dipping sauce were great. I didnt think I would like it but at the whole thing. Service was great. Staff informative and friendly and had decent prices for the meals. Highly recommended this place if you're in the area.
pos	I had the blue cheese burger and fried brussels sprouts. Both were extraordinary. This location is extremely clean and well taken care of. Awesome food, and burgers were cooked upon order. It took about 10 minutes for the order to come out but it was very much worth it. Fresh clean delicious food.
pos	This place had good service and good food so as a result I'll rate 5 stars. If a place has good service I usually let them slide since we can't leave half points. That being said, 4.1-4.9 would be appropriate. Sure there is some better food out there, but the service makes almost every meal taste better.  I get the impossible burger which I highly recommend. The brussel sprouts are good but a bit too oily in my opinion.
pos	They always do good food here, and it's basically equivalent style and quality to the location in the Ferry Building. Great burgers, excellent aiolis, and the sweet potato fries are great here too. Definitely don't skip the milkshake, because let's be honest, if you're coming here you're not counting calories.
pos	We came here specifically for the Impossible Burger.  We tried it on the Texas Avocado and on the Green Chile Burger.   The place was clean and big.  The service was reasonably efficient, and the place seemed like a nice place to spend Saturday lunch.  The line got huge towards 12:45, so arriving early is probably better.  This is my second time having an Impossible burger and I have to say I'm not going to get it again.  I've heard it is quite similar to beef, but I've never had a beef burger, so I'm not trying to match my mental image.  And I honestly prefer the burger patty at The Counter over the Impossible Burger.   Impossible burger was too salty, and seemed to focus on matching texture over tasting good.  I'll be back at Gotts, but will try the normal veggie burger.
pos	Gott’s is a delicious burger. This location is spacious and has lots of tables, so you’re rarely left standing. In the colder months there are heaters on the patio to keep eaters warm and in the summer, the patio is the best place to be.  Lots of options for veggies and vegans too, so everyone can enjoy a visit.
pos	Fabulous burgers and fries, great beer selection too.  Their ranch dressing is just the best, seriously delicious with the garlic fries.
pos	Been ordering Gott's regularly for the past few months, their burger is top notch and chicken tenders are amazing - also they provide you with the most delicious sauces. Exceptional service and always go above and beyond with any request. Thank you for everything Gotts!
neu	Food is overrated for the price and the staff isn't the most welcoming bunch
pos	Great food and they have Pliny on draft!
pos	Have been twice, both times spread apart by a year but it’s one of my favorite burger joints. Great food, old fashioned feel, old guy at the counter is super nice(does he own the place?) and it’s in a primal location(situated in the middle of a pretty busy walking district of the Stanford campus
pos	Easily one of the best burgers I've had. I got the Western bacon blue ring, and it was awesome. Starting with the egg bun which was slightly sweet, it comboed well with the burger patty that was seasoned properly and cooked to a correct medium pink. The onion ring on top was crispy and the blue cheese was not overpowering. I particularly enjoyed the BBQ sauce on the burger - sweet and tangy. Their garlic fries weren't too garlicky, unfortunately. They probably would have been more aptly named "parsley fries".
pos	I am in n out lover. This burger is way better.
pos	Gotts has some fantastic burgers and milkshakes! Their burgers are a smash style burger, and they really nailed it! Crispy edges of the patty, melty cheese, and a wonderful overall flavor. Their milkshakes are made with love, and are extremely satisfying. Really can't go wrong with this place
pos	Excellent vibe and outdoor area. The impossible burger and the beer is why I go. The salads are also very good. The burgers can be a bit dry 😬. The cashiers are a delight, the staff is great, but the food takes a little too long to come out.  @treatyousef
pos	Everyone at table had a burger except me I had chicken strips.  Was told burgers we're good.  Burgers don't come with a side so have to order that separately.  Onion rings we're good and so were fries.  Chicken strips were skinny and overcooked.  Was supposed to come with a side of vegetable strips which I didn't get.  Serves coke products and free refills.  Service was good.  Busy but clean. Would return.
neu	Decent, not the best Gott's I've been to.  We came here for a early dinner with the niece and nephew on a Saturday before the dinner rush. I had my usual order of Garlic Fries and the Cali burger. The fries weren't as crispy nor hot as I wanted and they somehow left out the avocado in my burger.  Service itself was good and the restaurant kept clean. They didn't have any issue accommodating a gluten allergy or splitting a small shake into two cups for the kids.  Warning: Parking in the area is a clusterf**k.
neg	Overpriced food and drinks.  Ordered a vegan burger with the impossible burger patty, and it came out with mayo on an egg bun. If they’re going to offer a burger vegan, they need to make sure their cooks and cashiers know what belongs on a vegan burger. Also forgot 1/3 beers ordered and had to be prompted to pour it - we were the only customers at the time.  Overall, 3 burgers with fries and beers came to almost $90. Might as well save your money and go somewhere with more personality and better quality food.
pos	Funny story of how we got here. Originally my folks and I were supposed to dine at Teleferic Barcelona, which is a very popular restaurant in the same complex.  However, the service was not on top of their game, it was very crowded and our table was not ready when we made the reservation. So we decided to go to Gott’s roadside and my goodness it was awesome! I had the Texas burger and I asked if they could substitute Turkey in place of beef, and they were more than happy to oblige!  The restaurant was doing a very good job of following COVID guidelines, high recommend going to this place!
neg	Their food used to be of great quality so that you didn’t mind the high price tag. Today was the third time over the past couple of months that my food was ice cold. $20 burger and onion rings after a 22 minute wait and it was inedible. 15 people behind the counter. Where is the quality control? I highly suggest you dine elsewhere.
pos	The staff were friendly and helpful. They explained my options with a lot of patience. They actually had seafood tacos. Never had one until now, tasty once you decide what to add or remove. This is a place to be if you have a nondiscrinating taste buds. If you're adventurous, go somewhere else.
pos	One of our faves- food is solid and (maybe best of all) reasonably priced! Kids love the shakes. Nice out door seating as well
pos	Simply awesome burgers! We go there frequently after my kids swim practice in the evening. The food is prepared fresh even if you order ahead as they don't want it to get soggy. Worth waiting the extra few minutes. My kids love it every time.
pos	Lively place with great burger options and patio seating. Their daily specials are usually tasty and if you want something healthier their salads are good too. An excellent selection of shakes and soft serve ice cream, I’d eat here every time I’m visiting Town and Country Village.
pos	Fun and easy place to enjoy a good American meal!  Famous for burgers and best of all they will cook your meat to order!  Veggie and gluten free options too.  Salads are nice for lighter fare and good selection of beer and wine.  But its better to have a root beer float!
pos	Love this place, have been here a couple of times. We love the cute little mall as well as the food here. They substitute all of their burgers with either a vegetarian patty or vegan impossible burger. The selection of sides as well as drinks is nice. Lastly, the outdoor seating on a warm day is a plus.. will go back when I am around here.
pos	Best burger period. My niece took me and I wasn't expecting anything special in taste. It was EXACTLY what I've always thought of a burger to be. And it was a turkey burger. Thank You for a great meal. I'll be back. Arnold
neg	Not a very good burger today. Cold uncooked garlic Fries and cold burger. Yuk This is my first time here. Really this is a 16$ lunch.
pos	Amazing. Nice menu, affordable prices and great atmosphere.
neu	Gott’s is tasty. I will totally admit that. Their burgers are juicy, their fries are well seasoned and the milkshakes are delicious. However, they are priced high at about $13 per burger and $6 for a hotdog and $4 for fries. Additionally, they are always understaffed or underresourced. It’s not uncommon to wait 30 minutes in line on Friday night then wait 30 minutes for your actual food.
pos	Great burgers! Get the Green Chile Burger, it's very tastey without being spicy.  The fries were really good too.  Great selection of beverages. Try the lemonade, it was so good, we got free refills to boot.
neu	Had lunch there yesterday. Not what I remember. Bother patties in the bacon double were very dry. For a $14 burger, I was hoping for a lot better.
pos	Delicious BBQ chicken sandwich and fine draught beer selection. Good milkshakes too. Garlic fries were pretty good, but I prefer fat ones not their skinny ones (whatever you call the thickness between "shoestring" and typical fast food type); but they were delicious.  Excellent seasonal (pumpkin) milkshake too!
neu	Burgers we ordered were good. They got 3 orders out of 8, incorrect. Also ironically two people in our party ordered tacos to get them faster, but they came out last and pretty much 20 minutes after the first burger came out.
pos	Visited during covid take out only but they had picnic tables and it was easy to remain socially distant from other parties. The food was good and though their system did somehow skip my order and was not made at first, they gave me a milkshake to make up for it. Probably the most impressive thing though was watching one of their runners literally run at full speed after a Door Dasher who was speeding away in his car after he forgot part of the order. He didn't catch him but I was impressed by his effort and determination to ensure the full order was taken to its recipient.
pos	Delicious burgers, delicious shakes, and excellent sides. I tried the Texas something burger, it had avocado, Jack cheese, pico, and mayo. I got it without pickled jalapenos. It was delicious. I tried to be adventureous and was very pleased. Definitely get an order if the onion rings. Nice batter, sweet onion, hearty size. The garlic fries were also scrumptious. Parsley and garlic filled every bite. They didn't even need ketchup (which Gotts makes from scratch). Had a black and white shake. Not what I'm used to, which is chocolate and vanilla blended together, but it was a vanilla shake with lots of chocolate sauce in it. I was thrown off at first, but it was very delicious. Good customer service. They actually got my burger order wrong but cooked me a new one on the fly and walked it out to me. Definitely try this place, your belly won't regret it!
pos	Friendly staff, delicious food. Feeling like a delicious classic burger? That's what I was lookin for and that's what I got, only better. I was enjoying a nice meal outside. Has other options, not only for salads and burgers.
pos	They were running an anniversary promotion and offering incredible service when I visited with friends. Burgers were novel and tasty. Decor was attractive. Prices I can't comment because of the promo. But seems like a well-meaning local restaurant. Highly recommend.
pos	Great burgers and Ahi poke tacos. Garlic fries are ok but don't have chunks of garlic like other joints. Sweet potato fries have lots of black pepper, making them a bit spicy, so not sure if I like the combo.  Fun atmosphere though.
pos	This is a descent place to have burger. If the price include burger, it would be better.
pos	Aside from the incredible food, consistancy, speed of service and friendly staff attitudes: Pliny the Elder on tap & Strauss soft serve ice cream. We really go out of our way to eat here. Plus, lots of outdoor seating. That means dog friendly!
pos	Our family enjoys a dinner out at Gott's. The kids like the hot dog, chicken fingers, and of course the milkshakes. For the adults the beer selection is good but the burger selection is better. There are great seasonal specials the compliment the year round menu.
pos	Pretty solid food, I go with the western bacon blue ring. Unfortunately the service is sooooo slow. You'd think it's because they make it a fresh, but twice in a row we've returned food because it's cold. They always have million people working so I'm not quite sure what the problem is.  Alas, we go back occasionally because the food is tasty and it's close.  One thing to note: if there's a sporting event at Stanford, everyone goes here from out of town, so beware of long wait times if there's a line.
pos	The burgers are good, they have a good variety of craft beers. What else do you need?. I find the ketchup and mustard particularly good in this place. I recommend the ahi tuna burger and the poke tacos. I just wish it were a bit cheaper.
pos	Great burgers, fries. Wonderful tasting, freshly made, well wrapped so you can eat them in your car without making a huge mess since indoor dining is unavailable.
pos	Excellent service and food.  Outdoor seating set up very well for both shade and sun at same table to accommodate all guests which we needed for a newborn and parents.
pos	Food was good. Its a little pricey though.
neg	The cheese on our burgers weren't melted and they got our order wrong. 2 stars because it was good last time but awful this time.
neg	You might think I'm kidding but they were out of fries! We got zucchini sticks instead and when our food was ready were told the zucchini sticks would take 8 more minutes. That is a bit ridiculous to me given that this is a burger and fries joint! The ahi tacos were great and you can tell they use quality ingredients, however they give little tuna so I felt like I was eating lettuce tacos most of the time. The burger was good (not memorable though). I'm bummed as I really wanted to love this place. Although I'm willing to try again assuming I came on an off night.
pos	Very tasty. Would definitely be back.
pos	Awesome food and drinks! Workers are very friendly and I will definitely be back again.
neg	Disappointed. Garlic fries skinny, soaked in butter, and I almost couldn't taste the garlic... I'm sorry, but I don't like my fries soggy and wet. Burger and fries served in the type of small paper cardboard you get at carnivals. Maybe if I got a drink it would've all been okay but the reviews here set me up for great expectations, and here I was $18 later and still hungry (and I don't have the proportions of a Stanford football player!). Maybe you need to be drunk to appreciate their food?
pos	Excellent food, fast service, affordable price.
pos	I love Gott's!!! I've been to their restaurant in Palo Alto and Napa and everything I've tried is great! Cheeseburger, Impossible Burger, Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich, Garlic Fries and salad are all great! Definitely deserves a repeat! Highly recommended!
pos	Very nice place and a wide selection of burgers and more! I can't think of anything to complain others than that the fries need to be saltier. If you have 15-20 minutes to spare for lunch, definitely try Gott's.
pos	Dinner here tonight was great. Got a pepper burger, double cheese burger, shrimp taco and mayo taco. The shrimp taco was “the best ever” according to my daughter. The burgers were tasty and the fries were well-cooked shoestrings. ✅
neu	I think the place here is over hyped. The burgers at Kirk's next door and at the Counter's are better. Food is just okay. Also this place is too crowded, so finding a seat is a challenge. The only good thing is that they had Pliney the Elder on tap.
pos	Best onion rings in town! Ahi tacos never disappoint and the burger is consistently great. Add in the great beer and wine selection and you have a family burger joint that is always a great meal.
pos	There were a lot of people there,  It was a Saturday afternoon afterall. Most of the tables were filled with families, and couples enjoying the beautiful weather. There are many tables inside, as well as two outside places to eat. The area right outside the eatery has smaller tables, whereas the tables a few feet away under the pergola were larger for bigger groups, or designef as a community dining opportunity. The food was scrumptious. There was a 15 minute wait in line prior to ordering, and a 25 minute wait for our pager to go off indicating our food was ready for us to pick up and enjoy. Go and see if that amount of time is worth it for you. Given the atmosphere, for us it was a nice easy way to spend a few hours. This is not "fast food", but what it lacks in speed, it makes up for in quality.
pos	Great burgers and dog friendly patio!
pos	Consistently high quality american fare with a California twist at an affordable price. In my opinion the best burger and the best milk shakes in town. Great selection of wines too. Fancy food without the fuss.
neu	Always slow and overpriced. A decent burger. They have an inefficient system and it always seems to take about 15 or 20 minutes for a burger and fries. Too slow considering number of staff and there isn't even table service.
neu	We ordered the California burger, Crispy teriyaki chicken burger,  fries & sweet potato fries which were room temperature cold, and the cauliflowers which the counter "strongly recommended" tasted very plain. Beef burger and garlic fries tasted better. All are pricey.
pos	I like this place because they serve a variety of hamburgers, and fries. This place is usually busy on the weekends. I recommend this place. I've been to the Palo Alto, San Francisco, and Walnut Creek location. You can't go wrong at any of these locations.
pos	Good burgers, okay fries (they're good just not my preferred fries) and excellent milkshakes. Ice tea is pretty good, too.
pos	Amazing lunch with 12 Stanford colleagues at Gott's yesterday!! Everyone loved the terrific food!!
pos	Clerk was so kind even though i am not a english native person so had some trouble during our conversation. Has a lot of sitting space inside and outside. You can see all the hard works they do through windows. Taste was also great. If you are looking for homemade burger, this is the place.
pos	Great food with tons of options. At first prices seem high but the portions are big and it's palo alto
pos	Great burgers and even better shakes!
pos	Really good burgers at a good price point. Line can be long during lunch time but they manage it well and work through orders fast. The outdoor patio is nice with big benches and tables.
pos	I LOVED THIS PLACE!! I got tacos and my friend got a classic burger. The burger was perfect and not like any other fast food place I have ever tried.  The fries were so goooood. I highly recommend this place.
pos	Price is high but burger was juicy and tasty.
pos	Pretty good fish tacos. I've had better, but this was a great evening out at 'family hour' -- 5:30 family dinner time. Festive, easy, kid friendly, and grownups can enjoy a glass of wine. Wonderful and highly recommended for families.
pos	Gott’s has good burgers and their lemon milkshake is so amazing. Having said this, their prices are a bit on the high side and so from a value perspective, it’s on a different level than In and Out. Having said this, they have a much broader menu and are worth checking out!
pos	My favorites are the Wisconsin Burger and Homemade Lemonade.
pos	Good burgers and love their garlic fries. Long line to the cashier but not a long wait for a table even on a Saturday night. One start deducted as the cashier missed the first thing we ordered.
neg	Extremely mediocre  Good - decor - size - big place - efficient from time to order til time food is ready - menu - onion rings! - fountain soda was nice and bubbly  Not as good - burger way overcooked, was never asked about preferred meat temp - kids menu is *not* for 12 year olds as it says. My 12 year old son and his 12 year old friend erupted in laughter at their lunches. One exclaimed "how in the world is this for 12 year olds?" - order was wrong. Ordered fries add cheddar and they came out without cheddar - bun was well below average
pos	The bacon cheese burger was delicious.  The black and white shake was really good and the sweet potato fries were crunchy and hot. All-around yummy!
neg	I have had several separate and verify distasteful occurrences, FORGET THIS PLACE! The burgers are made to tastle like nothing I can't even taste the tomato just dirty and oily grill taste that gives these burgers a horrible and cheap flavor. It's High priced garbage along with really nasty ( couldn't give a damn attitudes) wash that down with dogs pissing on the floor, negative manager and you have a recipe for the worst burger place I have ever been to. Save yourself from that and find something elsee this place will only disappoint you and your family!
neu	Greasy spoon, finger licking messy. To Go box had dirty grease prints. BLT sandwich had a healthy twist with avocado, juicy onion rings. Great place to have a quick meal with family or even on the go. Lots of Sunday traffic around Town and Country but this place didn't seem to appeal to that crowd, except for the spill over.
pos	The mushroom soup was fabulous. Excellent burger for a good price. Chili was fine, nothing special. Roasted brussel sprouts were crispy, salty and yummy. Get the mushroom soup.
neg	Placed a pick up order for 5:45pm. Got a text at 4:45pm saying my food was ready. Yes, I like my food cold, not sitting under a heating lamp. I don’t know many people who like cold burger/fries. Please think about your logistics if you claim to be a premium burger spot.
neu	No doubt the food is good. But their operations are questionable. With lines out the door, they continue to use one cashier. I would think that they would want to get people in and drinking. Also, that one cashier handles taking orders and prepping the drinks. So, his/her throughput is very low.
neu	Great atmosphere, good burgers and fries...but make sure your order is right before you eat.
neu	Nothing to write home about, but a solid burger. Fried foods we're a bit soggy. Wouldn't wait if the line is out the door.
pos	Great tasting turkey Cali burger. Sweet potato fries are a little salty and thei kale salad has a bit too much cheese. Overall great service and flavors.
neu	it's good, but too pricey. two burgers, two fries, a beer, and a shake for $50... burger was good, but not phenomenal - and for $14 for the sandwich only, i expect a bit more.. fries were served cold as well :(
neu	Delish. The garlic fries are superb.  This location gets severely backed up on the weekends. But seriously overpriced, but then again I was in PA, so what can one expect.  The Large shake is hardly larger than a regular.
neu	85 bucks for two burgers, a fry and an onion rings, two kids meals, two beers. A little steep to say the least. Good food, overpriced.
neg	Good food and friendly but short staffed and disorganized.  I ordered online,  my order was confirmed at a specific time,  I showed up at that time,  and got my food 20 minutes later after seeing that my order was sitting there.  There were lots of people in the same boat.
pos	I really enjoy this place. I will admit it's not the best deal price wise but I really enjoy the food. There is plenty of seating both inside and out, the garlic fries are delicious, the staff are friendly and the place is always clean. It's definitely my most frequent lunch stop at Town and Country.
pos	The perfect burger!!! No more to say
pos	Edit 2021-01-04: Sadly, they no longer use 3 Twins in their shakes. They are still good just not quite as good as they used to be.  While the burgers are good they aren't special. However, they use 3 Twins ice cream in their shakes and they use Sir Kensington for ketchup.  Yum!!!
pos	bacon cheeseburger and spicy tomato soup were tasty.  crowded at lunchtime during school season as full of kids.
pos	Great burger, salad and smoothie!
pos	Awesome burger and beer. Right across the street from Standford athletic center.
pos	Great burgers but not cheap by any means. Popular spot so expect a line to order if you come at a peak time. Usually worth the wait though
pos	Amazing food, great shakes. Only thing is it's sort of a wait, especially with doordash and online orders. Regardless definitely worth trying if in the area!
pos	Had a really tasty schnitzel sandwich here today.   Other than looking at the menu and ordering, it's currently all outdoor.
pos	This is my favorite go to place for burgers.  The line can be very long at times but it’s worth the wait.  The staff is sensitive to people with food allergy.
neg	Napkins? Don’t expect ’em. Good food? Meh. Places to sit? Not often. High price for it all? You bet!
pos	Gott's is awesome.  Ahi Burger FTW.  However, the location in Napa is better.  I think that this place doesn't have the same charm, but the food is still good.  The Ahi Burger that I got was a bit sloppy in presentation (c'mon, you can put in some effort when it's a $15 burger!) but that didn't really harm my enjoyment of it..  Overall, I'm glad that there is a location closer to me in the South Bay, but there is room for improvement!
pos	We're here every other year for water polo JO's and Gott's has always been a favorite place to meet and eat. The location couldn't be better. There is a ton of seating and very friendly staff. The menu is diverse with options for everyone. Put it on your list of places to eat in area.
pos	Eventhough we had junk food it tasted clean and didn't feel weighed down after. We went full out with burger sweet potato fries and root beer floats and it was amazing! Worth a cheat day!
neu	incredibly long wait time and very hard to find spots, especially at peak hours, but the food is good
pos	As always great food.  Only thing was quite a few "sold out" items.  Probably just a sign of the times with delivery impact because of covid.
pos	Good burgers and shakes. But also good seafood options!  Plenty of room when we were there for a late dinner.  I got the western blue ring burger.  We got a small shake to share and it was too small for that!
neg	Got there at 8:05 and they close at 8:30. Was told they are closing early and refused to take my order. When asked for the reason they are closing early, the employee said "I don't know". The closing information is listed on their Google listing, and physical location. Very disappointing considering I drove 30 minutes to get there.
neu	The space is decent, and the burger was good, but not worth $11 for a burger with no side dish. You’re paying for Palo Alto real estate prices, not for amazing food.
neg	burgers are too thin for the elevated prices. Every time I go, I am disappointed. The best thing is the ahi burger, if you have to eat here. And if you want a great burger, head down to mayfield, in the same shopping center. More expensive but worth it.
pos	Straightforward and great American food-burgers, fries and shakes.
neg	A sit-down restaurant wait, an average burger and fries, and a Palo Alto price tag is not a good combination. If you want a great burger for cheap, go to in and out. If you want a special burger for more money, go to Umami. Gott's didn't succeed in either of these categories for me.
pos	Had the fish tacos not sure about the beef (see photo lol)  was great friendly staff and easy to order
neg	The kimchi burger was extremely salty. I really like their sweet potato fries but the last two times I've had it they forgot to put seasoning on it :/
neu	Food was ok... burger got soggy before I could finish it... fries and ketchup were good. This was first time there so can't say if this is normal for them... maybe caught quality on a bad day.
neu	Meat was overcooked. They claim all burgers are medium, ours were thoroughly cooked. Other than that, good atmosphere; decent beer selection for burger place.
pos	Beside the price is a little bit higher than others places is worth give a try. I had chicken salad with avocado and it didn't disappoint me. I may come back to try the burgers.
pos	Epitome of the American Burger. Try the Impossible Burger. In true Silicon Valley fashion, it does not use real beef.
pos	Five stars would have been given if the soft serve was working.  My biggest disappointment the whole time i was there😳😪😥😭
neu	My friend got gotts and loved it. 15-20 minute wait, good service
neu	Food wasn't great (burger was over done and flavorless, kids chicken tenders were way overcooked and dry), but the staff was nice and they have beer and wine. Prices were higher than I was expecting though.
pos	Good burgers, tastes like a backyard cookout burger. Ordered: bacon cheeseburger. Tip: the secret sauce is a bit tangy, so for those who may not like tangy. Maybe sub for other condiments.
neg	Really bad experience, ordered impossible kimchi burger (vegetarian - no egg/no meat) and they give me some other burger, start bitting into it...this kid comes in the middle and says there was a mistake and takes it back. Brings me the Kimchi burger and says it's vegan (as it has the white wrapper) and then I bite into it....bloody thing has bacon in it. These idiots don't understand when someone says No MEAT?????? This is ridiculous, never step Into this place of you are a vegetarian.
pos	Plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. Specials today were great, crab sandwich and pistachio shake.
neu	Gott's is ok, the one in St. Helena is better but it's still average burgers and $$ too.  Ok when you need something in a pinch.  My wife likes that they serve wine ;-)
neu	The burgers are pretty good here, but the prices are too high in my opinion. They do have good beer on tap though. Ballast Point Sculpin? Yes please!
pos	Great food and great staff. Ate here a lot before COVID, had lots of takeouts during, order has been on time, hot and correct every single time. Great job!!
pos	Honestly some of the best food in the area. The staff is really accommodating and are on it. There’s always a little wait but there’s a reason. The food is 100% every time. They don’t miss. And if there is any issue they fix it immediately with a smile.
pos	Such a unique little diner with a cool college town vibe. Burgers were awesome as were the milkshakes. This would be a regular stop for burgers if I lived there
pos	Winsconsin burger and garlic fries !!!! The. Best
neu	I didn't get a burger. I got a salad. It was tasty but nothing special. The onion rings were light and delicious.
neu	Pricy pricy pricy. I can't complain about my burger or shake (the strawberry shake is tasty). But the price is just so tough to justify. I blame shake shack for normalizing a $20+ meal at a burger joint.
pos	Gluten free and vegetarian friendly, good burgers.
neg	I had a good experience here once then now my burger was cold and literally had some meat scraps for a patty... I didn't really understand it so I returned but the manager said that's how it should look like. Never coming back again.
pos	Best burgers I've ever had!  Just perfect, not too greasy, not too messy. And their shakes are 🔥🔥🔥
pos	Good Spot , great food and beer
neg	The shrimp and crab Louie or salad was horrible. Very cheap on the proportions and not what I expected. What a waste of $25 before tip. I will not recommended this place to anyone.
pos	The hamburgers where great. The price is kind of high. But everything in the bay area is.
pos	Great burgers, crispy fries, and friends
pos	Great burgers, good seating area, love the ice cream shakes, order lines can be way more faster for all the staff they have.
neg	Can't even rate this place.  Wish I could give it negative stars.  The food terrible, and the portions were just plain small for the price they charge.  Ordered  Chicken tenders for my child and all it was, was a ton fries and three tiny, overcooked, chicken twigs.  It wouldn't even constitute as poultry.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!  DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!
pos	This local chain is a hot spot for burgers, shakes, fries, and their unique staple ahi tuna tacos. The Palo Alto location features a few outdoor tables. Located in Town and Country Village, you can get a little shopping in before or after your meal.
pos	Burgers are good, fries never disappoint, and the  place itself is inviting.  Only issue is that the prices are a bit too much for what you get.
pos	Great food, great beverages, great desserts. Outdoor dining is properly spaced out and has high walls for separate cubicles.
pos	The Avocado Tacos and Summer Lobster Roll are out of this world. The staff is also very friendly and patient.
neu	Cool location, burgers adequate
pos	Great burgers at a very reasonable price. They also serve the impossible burger which was cooked perfectly. Pliny the Elder on tap!
pos	Our burger, fries, and ahi tacos all tasted great. I was surprised by the freshness of the tuna
neu	This is our second visit. Our first time was a few months after it opened and it was a disaster. We vowed we would never go back and until today we didn't. This time the service issues that plagued our first visit were fixed and the food was good. Good to know that at least it is decent these days.
pos	Best burgers period. In fact, anything I've had here (tuna tacos, garlic fries, etc.) are also the best!!!
pos	The food is so good. And outdoor seating is excellent.
pos	My go-to spot for the Impossible cheeseburger and a pint of Pliny!
pos	A nice and cozy place. Sometimes they cook too long (about 15 minuts for mere hamburger.) but the food itself very juicy and tasty.
pos	Hamburgers where delicious and garlic frys.
pos	Relax place to get a bite. A little slow to get food when thete is a line.
pos	Great burgers and fries; they take a while to bring your food and the restaurant is always freezing. Try the tuna tacos - very good!
pos	Nice burgers with excellent flavor. Mine was well done. Next time I'll ask for medium rare
pos	A must every time we go to a Stanford game! Wish they were open later.
pos	You pay a premium but the best burgers in the area. Ahi Tuna Tacos are great too.  Get the garlic fries!
pos	Ashley was a kick. A young girl who loves her job. Love gotts and personality made the experience the best. Never had bad food at any gotts.
neu	Pricey, decent food, good selection, good location & outdoor seating. Good burgers, poke tacos need improvement, yummy shakes
neu	A bit overpriced for the taste. There are better burger places in the area for less.
pos	I had the Western Bacon Blue Ring burger with garlic fries. The best I've had in a long time. Absolutely delicious!
pos	Good burger, line to order it, but it moved quickly. Both indoor and outdoor seating. Blue Bottle iced coffee...yum!
pos	The burger is all right, not extraordinary but the fries is amazing! Must try the garlic fries or the sweet potato fries.
neg	How do you mess up a burger? Food was really bad. Would not recommend.
pos	Great food and outside dining,  they even have heaters for evenings if it gets cold.
pos	We went there to try the Impossible Burger. It tasted much like a conventional burger. Gott's is trendy, with prices to match.
pos	Great Menu for Salads, Burgers, Sandwiches or Tacos
pos	If you like hot dogs this is your place. I love hot dogs & there buns, oh my. Go there, you won't be disappointed.
pos	They make familiar food very, very well. I don’t see any reason to go to any other similarly-priced burger/sandwich joints ahead of Gott’s.
pos	Enjoyed the impossible burger, glad to finally have the chance to try it. I would also recommend the sweet potato fries.
neg	Since my previous review (4 months ago my most recent experiences there were not so great and were handled very poorly. I wont be taking my family here again and support a business that is highly priced for mediocre quality food and a lack of customer service.  I dont know what their damage is with the sauces?! If you are paying $50 or more for a family of 3 to dine there and because we love ranch with our fries and chicken tenders, why give us the attitude when we ask for more ranch?  Is the business doing that bad that they have to make a customer feel like its a burden or a crime to ask for more ranch? We work in Palo Alto, 5 minutes away from Towne and Country so its been a conveniance more than a selection for the times we have dined here. I hope more and more patrons who feel the same way come out and post their experiences  and express how pathetic Gotts really is.
pos	So. Flipping. Amazing. Get an $11 bacon cheeseburger, share some hot salty fries with your stud, grab some suds, and watch all the college kids wear bootie shorts  and remember the good ol' days when you used to publicly hang your body parts out in public:)
neg	It was horrible! The manager Michel didn’t want to sell me food and beer because I am from Colombia and he thought that my ID was fake just because I am from a foreign country. I am 24 years old I was born in 1993. His actitud was really disrespectful. I can’t believe it!
pos	Ahhhh.... the tasty burger!!
pos	Expensive, but seriously had the best veggie burger ever. (And no, I’m not a vegetarian but I rock One every now & then - and that one is incredible.
pos	One of the best burgers in the area.  Try the onion rings!  4 stars cause they are very pricey.
neg	Ordered online and was given a 45 min ETA. Had to wait outside the store for half an hour (15 minutes past the online order due), all while seeing people who order in store get their food in like 10 minutes.
pos	Fresh food, efficient service, good beer, wine, and once cream/milkshake selection. Great for a casual bite while shopping in the town and country center.
neg	Don't bother. There are a dozen places in the same shopping centre that do better and some more that are just as good. Schlock. Even the paper napkins and condiments are sub-standard.
neg	I ordered about an hour ago. Smells good , but I’m still waiting for my food . For a fast food burger place with no one in it, this isn’t very fast. I’m getting hangry
pos	Tasty bites, fun atmosphere. Also, they serve the impossible burger, so it's good to have a meatless option.
pos	Loved the service and the food,very disable friendly (grandmother's on a cane and was able to navigate smoothly) ordered the Kimchi burger and it was fabulous
pos	The burgers always fresh fresh shrimp fresh batter all made by hand special made with the delicious taste fried Deluxe can't go wrong
pos	The bbq chicken sandwich and the Texas avocado burger were SO GOOD!!! You also can't go wrong with a chocolate shake😋
pos	Great burger and fries joint with outside dining available
neu	Food was OK but expensive for what you get. Long line to order, long wait for food.
pos	Great service, the best sweet potato french fries and bacon cheeseburger! Also cool bartenders.
pos	Delicious hamburger and gluten free bun. I love that they have Sir Kensingtons condiments. Yummy!
pos	I enjoyed my hamburger and wine. Gott's has the feel of a restaurant burger with the comfort of dining without a waiter.
pos	Large seating area. Love the poke tacos
pos	Solid burgers and fries, good experience.  I personally prefer the Dutch Goose, but this place is solid if you are on this side of campus.
pos	We love this burger joint! 7 of us went for lunch and everyone enjoyed their meal!
pos	Delicious burgers and sandwiches, awesome onion rings. Lots of seating indoor and outdoor, and they serve beer on tap, and wine.
neu	I used to love it, but it just was okay.
pos	The impossible burger did not live up to the expectations.
pos	Safe for Celiacs (fries fried separately), good burgers, plenty of seating indoor and outdoor. Good for kids
neu	Burgers were ok.  Special sauce is spicy. Black and white shake was good though!
pos	Nice menu, lots of choices, burgers, salads, soups, seafood (yes), fries and more! Clean fresh atmosphere, polite employees.
pos	Great burgers, spicy sweet 'tater fries, great for families, especially the outdoor seating.
pos	Great burgers. I love the burger with lettuce wrap instead of a bunch. Secret sauce is delicious!
pos	Great Burgers and dogs, nice selection of side's and beers
pos	Awesome burgers of yo uh are vegetarian as they have each butger also available with impossible or veggie patty
neu	Burgers are pretty good, but a little too greasy. Great variety of toppings though
pos	Very good variety of burgers and other dishes that are tasty and fresh with friendly service.
pos	Super tasty, serves a great impossible burger. Just wish it were a little cheaper!
neu	Overpriced. Burger was ok. I've had better.
neu	Good food but be ready to wait for your order, this is not fast food place, and put out about 20$ for burger and fries.
pos	The line moves fast and the burgers are delicious. It's a very welcoming establishment.
pos	Great burgers, fried, everything. Nice space, decent serving time and great menu.
pos	The impossible nuggets are surprisingly good. I did not expect them to be so good.
pos	Great beers & great burgers.
neu	Decent burgers but much more expensive than similar. Order at front, sit down and wait for number to be called kind of place
pos	Nice place to get Yummy burgers.
neu	Decent but not outstanding burger.  Fries were hot and crisp.  Noisy.
neu	Burger was good but overpriced

pos	This restaurant is spectacular. One of my vegan friends recommended Wildseed, and it did not disappoint. Not being a vegan myself, I'm always a bit skeptical. However, the food on the menu, definitely satisfies the pallet. Not to mention, the vegan meat options taste like real meat. The staff is extremely friendly, especially Pillar. I would certainly come back, and recommend it to friends in the future.
pos	Kudos to the chef, menu designer, and staff.  This is the plant based food place that you can bring your omnivorous and carnivorous friends to.  Every thing we ordered - cauliflower, burgers, salads, was so tasty.  My good friend from Oklahoma who loves all meat was not only satisfied, but wants to come back.  He is seriously thinking about plant based food.  Definitely, best new restaurant.  Loved it.
pos	I love this place. I have been to the location in San Francisco a few times, but loved this setting even more. The patio is pretty and relaxing. I loved the chips with sour cream and onion dip, not sure why this is not on the menu at the SF location. Had the hummus and chilled veggies, not sure how they make the veggies so cold and flavorful, so fresh and yummy. The server Mackenzie was luminous and had a soothing energy. I will 100% be back.  Hummus and veggies - 10/10 Onion dip and chips - 8/10 Panda cotta - interesting 7/10 Latte 9/10 Dog friend I met on patio - 10/10 Mackenzie 10/10 Patio ambiance 10/10
pos	Highly recommend! Local and delicious with a wide variety of tasty dishes. Everything we ordered was fantastic, from the potato chips with fresh onion dip, to the smokey hummus, roasted cauliflower, and flatbread topped with tender arugula, cashews and mushrooms.  And the summertime drinks complimented all of the dishes well.
pos	I was here with my girlfriends for Friday night dinner! We had an amazing time! Palo alto had cute outdoor seating and the service was great! It really showed they were making efforts towards becoming sustainable. We ordered marinated olives, curried cauliflower and mezze plate for appetizers and they all tasted amazing. The impossible burger was a little too salty for our liking and not the best we've had. Most of their plates had mushroom so I went with the ensalada salad which wasn't so good. Their drinks are worth a mention- even the non-alcoholic ones! Will visit again !
pos	Such a fantastic place! We could not trust the hype about this place but the food was so delicious. It's always crowded and we had to wait even with a reservation (I wish this could be improved). When we got to the host, we were sat immediately and we ordered and had food in 10 minutes. Everything was so good, tasty and surprising. It's expensive compared to average restaurants in the area but not a lot. We are glad more amazing vegan restaurants are opening!
pos	Excellent vegan pallet. Good choice of taste. Waiters are courteous and knowledgeable. The sourcing of veggies and other raw materials is top class, which is reflected in the freshness of the sauces, and the liveliness of the mushrooms. We tried the Wild Mushroom Zeppole, Probiotic Bowl, Bucatini, and Panna Cotta for dessert. Would definitely recommend Probiotic Bowl (Charred mushroom was spot on). Panna Cotta felt a bit creamy-coconuty, but was flavorful with the blueberry jam. Overall, would recommend and go again.
pos	I’ve been wanting to try wildseed in the city for the longest time and I’m glad it has finally come to the Bay. This place is a delight for vegetarian and vegan clan. Menu has a wide range of multi-cuisine dishes. We ordered quite a few dishes and all were amazing. It’s priced just right and the desserts are not to be missed. We ordered the polenta cakes, wild mushroom fritters, wildseed burger, neatball masala and flaxseed cookie. For drinks, we ordered 0%abv (non-alcoholic) telegraph hill and beet soda. They have an ambient setup indoor and outdoor. Parking is easy to find in this plaza but there might be some traffic/wait on weekends. This is definitely going to be one of our dinner date spots.
pos	A wonderful experience, albeit on the expensive side, but the quality matches the pricing and as far as vegan goes they have both creative and very very satisfying dishes. We were a party of four and all of us had a spectacular experience. The cashew cheesecake is to die for.
pos	You won't miss meat.  Everything we ordered was delicious. The service is slow due to low waitstaff.  We ordered the mushroom fritter as an appetizer it was served after we had our main course.
pos	It’s a beautiful place with good music and interiors. The food was awesome 👏🏻 we choose this restaurant specially because it serves Vegan food as my daughter is allergic to milk  protein and nuts. And without any doubt the food was super delicious 🤤 and presentation was also beautiful! Even the desserts were awesome 😎! Giving one star less because of the service! Just that we had to call the server again and again! You need to prebook as the place is full! But it’s a must try specially for VEGAN lovers! We ordered spicy thai curry and a flatbread the thai curry was super tasty and mild spicy!
pos	I've been wanting to try wildseed for a while now and am so glad I finally got the chance to go. Everything on the menu sounds delicious so it's hard to decide what to get. Ended up withba bowl, the Flatbread as a main and the chocolate cake as well the cheese cake for dessert. Everything tasted amazing. Drinks were very unique and great as well!  Service is not the best. It was busy and instead of helping, the manager/trainer just stood around waiting for the hostess to return from somewhere and then just told her: "see this is the reason why you I need you stay here" - seems like a terrible manager/trainer to me.
neu	Nothing great in terms of taste. It’s more of a breakfast/brunch place. Curried cauliflower was really good. Neatball masala was bland and sweet. Omelette dish was also sweet. Wouldn’t go again. Cilantro they had added in our dishes were not washed well so could taste the dirt coming out of it. I did let our server know so he can tell the chef. Only good part was the customer service from our server (think Andrew) who was super good attending to almost the entire section. He was super kind.
pos	SOLID vegan place - I almost thought it wasn't vegan because the cheese tasted like cheese and the meat like meat.  Good: - Loved the green flatbread - I am not usually a fan of arugula, but it worked really well in the pizza - the dish was a great portion size - almost too big for 2 people - The orecchiette pasta was great too - super creamy and probably more of my favorite than the flatbread. We finished it super fast and also a great portion size - We were seated super quickly since we had a reservation and I'd recommend everyone get one before coming!  Bad: - Definitely a long wait time for food - the place is packed!  Overall really enjoyed the experience and would come again for different menu items! The food was high quality and the place was aesthetic.
pos	I am a life long vegetarian (never had meat ). I love Indian and Italian cuisines which I think suit the vegetarian palate the best. I heard about this place from a friend of mine who rated this place highly. I was skeptical of this place but was pleasantly surprised as to how tasty food was. We ordered Mexican corn cake, ceviche of trumpet mushroom, probiotic bowl and Mezze plate. Everything was tasty. Highly recommend this place
pos	Absolutely phenomenal 100% vegan food. Enjoyed dinner outside on the patio and did not have to wait for a table on Thursday. The green forest flatbread was one of the best dishes I've ever had. The smoked cashew cheese on the flatbread is amazing. The tofu skewer was good but not great, especially for the price. Definitely recommend visiting
pos	Amazing vegan place. We ordered the Mexican corn cakes, Curried cauliflower, Veggie flatbread, and the chilled soba noodles. We also ordered the cashew cheesecake for dessert. Everything tasted amazing. The ambience was great too. Highly recommend this place.
pos	Loved the place. Went there with low expectations but turned out to be so good. Never thought I'd enjoy vegan food so much. The staff is super good and the service is fast too. We ordered the passion tea, Mexican corn cakes, Mezze plate and ended with a delicious warm chocolate cake. Will be visiting again soon.
pos	The food here was amazing! My boy friend, my puppy and I came here on our way to san fransisco and this place did not disappoint. We got the baba ghanoush (not pictured) and ceviche of king turmpet mushroom, both ridiculously delicious. So simple yet the spices/sauces they used were of a great combination. We got Espressotinis and they were amazingly strong yet you didnt taste it, you just tasted deliciousness. And as for our main we got neatball masala and orchiette alla pugliese. If you like a little spicy the pasta was delicious! Not to take away from how tasty the neatball masala was. Again, simple yet with perfect combinations of ingredients! Would def come back and recommend this place. The staff was amazing and they brought our food in a timely manner as well!
pos	Delicious vegetarian options! The flat bread is flavorful and so crispy. They have tasty refreshing drinks!
pos	I’d skip the risotto next time (fine but nothing special, especially as a non-vegan), but everything else was excellent, especially both flatbreads. Otherwise the space is nice, but I felt the tables were crammed in too close together
pos	Just visited the newly-opened Wildseed in Town & Country, and we were pleasantly surprised by the fantastic dining experience. Palo Alto has long been in need of a hip, plant-based restaurant, and Wildseed fits the bill. The servers were friendly and attentive, and the ample heaters made our outdoor table nice and cozy. We really enjoyed our appetizer of the Mexican corn cakes and the risotto, but what stole the show was the spicy yellow curry with forbidden rice. It arrived to the table piping hot, and every last bite was positively scrumptious. The chocolate cake was good too, but definitely not a substitute for the stuff eggs, milk, and butter are made of! Will try some of the other dessert offerings next time since we will definitely be back and will bring friends as well.
pos	I’ve been wanting to go to the famed wild seed in SF for a while now which didn’t happen for one reason or another so I was really excited when I saw that wildseed was opening another location in Palo Alto because I could finally try it without going out of my way! For a Saturday night dinner, we made a  reservation about 3-4 days out. The extended strip mall location is was in was just a little hard for me to navigate at night but nothing too complicated. We were seated indoors and wildseed has a lovely bohemian vibe going with a giant mural of monstera painted on one of the walls and little plants hanging from the ceiling by the window. As a plant enthusiast, I loved the coziness it offers. For appetizers we ordered the polenta cakes, pea tendrils and the sour cream and onion dip. Pi was not a huge fan of the pea tendrils-it seemed like cooked spinach leaves with pine nuts and raisins. Loved the polenta cakes- which were like cornbread with a mushroom sauce. The dip and potato chips were also good!  Absolutely loved the main course where I ordered tofu skewers! Amaaaazing! Everything about it- presentation, flavor profile, textures, the side dishes that came with the tofu was fantastic! Perfect if you aren’t too hungry!  The dessert with the citrus almond cake- these should be handed out as rewards instead of trophies! The texture of the cake, with orange and coconut whipped cream and the cocoa nibs- ah! Perfection.  I loved our interactions with the lovely lady who waited on us to! She had great and more importantly, honest recommendations!  Overall a great experience and would definitely come back for more!
pos	This is an all vegan restaurant. I went here purely on accident. We actually were on a waiting list at a nearby spot, but due to some technical issues, Wildseed had been unable to take reservations, so we walked right in!  The servers are so nice and helpful with the menu. We ended up getting the Mezze plate and Mexican corn cake appetizers, two pizzas- the spicy “sausage” and a broccoli pizza I think, (everything is plant based), and man- everything was so, so good. I’m not vegan or even vegetarian, and I want to be the first to say nobody at our table was missing meat or animal products.  We even got desert- panna cotta, Meyer lemon cheesecake, and a chocolate cake. The third desert was an accident by the kitchen - but we were so happy! Everything was so wonderfully made. You can tell they put a lot of love into what they do, and it shows.
pos	Made a reservation for brunch on a Saturday. It wasn’t too crowded and we probably could have walked in too. We sat indoors but they have pet-friendly outdoor seating too.  We got Mexican corn cakes, banana fritters, reset salad and spicy sausage omlet (all vegan). The sauce on the corn cakes was out of this world! The reset salad was light and refreshing. Banana fritters was probably the most filling of the dishes we had ordered, but it was just right- not too heavy or sweet. Spicy sausage omelet came with sides of russet potatoes and toast. The sausage really made the whole thing very flavorful. Not everyone appreciated the sauce on the omelet- I thought it went well though.  Service was very quick. We the salad and corn cakes almost instantaneously. Would definitely come here again.
pos	Amazing food, thoughtful service and great staff! Definitely coming back, hands down one of the best restaurants in the Bay Area!
pos	The pasta was amazing and my wife loved the wild seed burger. Great cocktails/ mocktails with fresh juices made in house.
pos	New Wildseed Vegan Restaurant in Palo Alto! Beautiful presentation, many wonderful menu choices, friendly atmosphere. Great to have healthy, tasty dining options!
pos	they have such a good selection of vegan food. we got some olives, chips + sour cream and onion dip, and *delicious* polenta cakes as appetizers. I ordered the bucatini for dinner. the pasta was thick and the sauce was creamy - thinking about it now makes me salivate :D
pos	Love to see vegan (plant based) restaurants coming to the Bay Area Peninsula. Everything we ordered was amazing and flavorful.
pos	Recommend the corn cakes and the green flatbread. All food was very tasty! Would definitely come back
neu	Food was nice and tasty. However the tofu skewers were definitely not worth $26. We also ordered starter, mezze plate,  but it reached our table after we ate half of the main meal. Drinks arrived even later. Next time we would skip the desserts. It was busy sure, but also chaotic. The waitress was going around every table looking whose food she is carrying. Food was good but there is definitely much to be improved.
pos	A party of 5, we had reservations for the first seating at 5pm on a Friday evening.  We had tickets to see Halsey at Shoreline at 7 and wanted to hear the opening acts.  Had to wait 10 to 15 minutes for our table, but the server was quick to answer our questions and take our orders. We ordered a large selection of menu items and enjoyed them all.  The best dining experience I (see Epic Steak review) have had at a Vegetarian Restaurant.  The food was flavorful and as described, the textures approximated the foods that they were replacing (sausage, cheese, etc.) And the overall flavors were exceptionally good.  And, they got us out the door on time to hear the opening notes of the opening act from our seats!  Bravo!
pos	Pretty typical new American cuisine. Dishes are tasty but not "clever", so to speak. For example, I like the idea of having a noodle salad with a lot of dressing, resembling cold soup. However, the dressing was too seasoned to be considered soup (not something you can enjoy with a spoon) and overtook the flavor of everything else on the plate. Service was meh. For example, we got our food before we got our drinks. When paying $20-25 per plate, I really expect better, more "clever" service. Not a bad place, of course, but will probably not come back again for a while.
pos	Wildseed proved that a 100% plant-based menu can be just as delicious and flavorful, if not more.
pos	Overall it was a good experience. Very good use of vegan ingredients and very original recipes, however they went a bit overboard with the spices to add more punchy flavors. Their music was too loud at times with some interesting choices, but the service was good.
pos	Our group had the corn cakes, mezze plate, spicy curry, watermelon salad, and the orrichiette. All of them were amazing and substantial - I left the meal feeling quite full.  The pricing wasn't too bad - not so mind-blowing in itself to want a fifth star from me, but the vegan angle, given how good the food was, is noteworthy, and hence the fifth star.
neg	Honestly, this place is coasting and is barely better than vegan fast food joints that are half the price.  The mushroom ceviche tasted like orange juice and lime soaked cucumber, and came with a avocado that basically just a huge lump spooned out of the peel.  the cheese on the sausage flatbread has the classic vegan cheese plastic taste (which I expect when using it at home or at a fast food place) and the sausage was in large dry clumps.  I've been here other times and had more "ok" dishes, but today was a big disappointment.  I'm going to keep coming here, because there's no place down here like it and I hate meat on a menu, but it's really not worth it. I also don't blame the kitchen staff; it's a lazily crafted menu with mediocre ingredients.  Palo Alto needs tasty, innovative, vegetarian cuisine in this price bracket. This isn't it.  Servers are great.
pos	*impossible burger - got with cheese, delicious. Fries were standard, good. *flaxseed red velvet pancakes - good, loved the whipped creme, could have used even a little more *green forest flatbread - 10/10 soo good  All vegan place!
pos	The food was delicious and very filling! The staff is nice too! Minus one star because I didn’t like the drinks. We ordered a golden latte and an ice tea and both were extremely sweet
neg	Food, dessert, and service is great but I am not a fan of the bartender that made this $14 drink all ice.
pos	Wildseed is always a solid lunch/dinner option, with interesting drinks on the menu and rotating starters.  I particularly like the mushroom dishes, as well as the non alcoholic drinks, which always have something unique to offer, whether it is a seasonal fruit kefir or a seedlip mocktail.  However! I find myself gravitating towards a meal of just appetizers, which speaks a lot about the appeal of the mains. Also, dessert menu doesn’t really change, so while the options are pretty good, it would be nice to try something new every now and again.
pos	Very nice ambiance, lots of outdoor and indoor seating. The waiters were super friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the food and mocktails. Definitely coming back and recommending to others
pos	Excellent restaurant we loved it so much we almost went every day while visiting. Food is fresh, ingredients are in season, menu is well built, meals are delicious. Highly recommend!
pos	Great dishes and variety of food. Everything came out quickly and was very tasty
pos	I took my mom for lunch. The food was beautiful and delicious. The staff was friendly and the environment including the clientele was upbeat. Great experience all around.
pos	Excellent vegan food... We tried Mexican cakes, flatbread and risotto ... All of them tasted excellent. Will be visiting again.
pos	Wonderful food, service, and atmosphere. My husband is not vegan and loved the orecchiette pasta dish without the sausage.
pos	Super friendly staff and amazing food. Plant based is the way — delicious, creative, nourishing. Neatball masala is sooo good
pos	Pretty innovative vegan food. The mezze plate and corn cakes were really good.
pos	Definitely like the SF branch more. Food was served quickly.
pos	Creative plant based restaurant with good service. Conveniently located in a shopping center. My wife & I had the mezze plate, green forest flatbread, risotto primavera, warm chocolate cake, beet soda, & cucumber basil shrub soda. All the food was good. We've had other items at their San Francisco location as well.
neu	I love Wildseed, and go often to the location in San Francisco. I was excited to see the menu is slightly different at this new location and tried the tofu kebab. The flavor of this dish is wonderful, I had no complaints about the way it tasted. The truth is though, that is was extremely overpriced. It’s the most expensive item on the menu at $26 and I was sad to see that I got 3 pieces of tofu, 3 pieces of potato and some onions. I left feeling very hungry. Either this price of this item needs to go down or the amount of food needs to go up.
pos	EXCELLENT FOOD AND EXCELLENT SERVICE. We came here on a Sunday evening near the end of dinner service. We loved our server and loved our food. We tried the wildseed burger, harvest bowl, neatball masala, polenta cakes, and the risotto primavera. All these items tasted excellent and were jam packed with layers of flavor. At first, the risotto was a bit salty, so we sent it back and it got fixed super fast. It tasted super good, and I commend their staff for fixing this.  Our waitress was also super nice and very professional. For dessert we had the caracara orange cake and the cheesecake. Both were super amazing. Also... i cant believe its all vegan!!!!
pos	Omg...dessert and pizza ...yaaaasss
pos	This is the first place where I was impressed with their vegan options and loved it a lot. I would definitely go back to try other options and recommend this place to everyone.
pos	Only been here once and was compelled to write a good review right away. Service is super friendly, and their spicy yellow curry was done perfectly. Can’t wait to come back
neu	Repeat customer, usually pretty good. This time the flatbread came out pretty much ice cold. Little bit disappointing.
neg	If you’re white customer you will be served within seconds. Came here for a birthday dinner and had to hail the waitress to get us water and take our order. She served the white customers that came after us first. Very disappointing…
pos	Great ambience and food. Lots of vegetarian options, our favourite was the mushroom appetizer.
pos	Bit bland food, good outdoor ambience
pos	Amazing vegan restaurant! Took my mom here for mother's day and it was an amazing dinner.
pos	Outstanding. Go! You will enjoy all they have to offer. Reservations a must!
pos	Great food and amazing service. Love the farm fresh and innovative recipes
pos	Loved their biscuits and gravy. Nice smoothies too!
pos	Plant based restaurant at a great location! Lots of options with changing menus with the season.
pos	Wow, drinks were delicious, food is pretty good if you're ok with Vegan. Good GF options
neg	Didn’t like any of the dishes we ordered 😢. Service was very nice, however
pos	What an amazingly different restaurant.  The menu blew me away ... with the variety.
pos	Great selection,  difficult to decide, everything was great, will be back
neg	Overpriced food with misleading portions advertised. Contacted restaurant regarding negative experience and never heard back.
neg	Rude service, overpriced food & drinks. There are better choices.
pos	Delicious!!!! Love the friendliness of the staff,  promptness, and amazingly fresh flavors.
pos	Amazing food - it's so hard to pick what to get. Everything has been delicious.
pos	One of best restaurants in the peninsula. Everything is delicious - from the appetizers to the desserts.
pos	Delicious vegan food, the best around here
pos	The best vegan Restaurant in the area.
pos	My favorite place! The panda cotta is to die for!
pos	Exorbitantly priced for fine dining experience.

pos	Best vegan restaurant at south bay
pos	Delicious and I made new friends!!
pos	Great vegan food and service
pos	Great service and yummy food
pos	Delicious & unique food, cosy place
pos	Great food and drinks
pos	Delicious addition to Palo Alto!
pos	Great flavor
pos	Good food and service.
neu	This is a fine dining restaurant, and I've liked the service before. Now they use Toast for ordering, and our drinks came after the appetizer  which came after the entrees. No, I don't like that.
pos	It’s still super delicious even if you’re not a vegetarian. Even if you eat a lot, you’ll still be full. It’s fun to share the side dishes first. The cocktails are very distinctive, and they all go well with vegetables. Just no outside tables otherwise the ambience would be 5/5. Will definitely be back anyway!
pos	Excellent
pos	Comfortable casual sushi, friendly outdoor seating... I've been wanting to try this place for a while and dropped by for a late lunch, a spicy hamachi roll and salmon maki. Fresh, tasty, and a great value, I'm looking forward to trying more.
pos	What a great casual spot to grab some delicious sushi. The food is tasty, service amazing, and very quick too which always helps when the family's hungry.
neg	Notes to self about the lunch beef teriyaki takeout.  Not impressed. Not authentic. Beef teriyaki was way overcooked and no sauce (dry, see picture). Salad was good, the dressing was heavily oil based. The cali rolls were surprisingly good. Sushi maybe the go to for this place. However, this is based on the 2 piece cali roll I had.
neg	We have been regular customers for years, including through the pandemic. Tonight we came in ordering three sushi rolls for our five year old who had his heart set on ikura for dinner. It took exactly 57 minutes for them to deliver three sushi rolls. They recently reopened the dining room, and they're still doing a vigorous online order business. The kitchen was packed full of staff, and we were lied to three times by the service staff who said the food would be out in 5 minutes or less. 57 minutes is an unacceptable amount of time to wait for 3 rolls of sushi. If they had let us know that it would be anything beyond a reasonable 20 minutes, we would have gone elsewhere. We won't be back anytime soon; an hour for a tiny tray of sushi is UNACCEPTABLE.
neu	Great price, but rather small rolls. I normally have 1 to 1-1/2 for a sitting. I ordered 3 from here and completely demolished them.
pos	This place was great.  Reasonably priced and extremely tasty.  Fish was fresh and everything tasted really good
neg	The staff was nice enough, but I’m sorry to say that the sushi was awful — much worse than airport or supermarket sushi. We left much of what we ordered uneaten. Based on my experience, I would definitely avoid.
pos	Plent of space to eat outisde. Fairly reasonable price for sushi. 11 pieces were less than 10$. There is a clear sign outside that mentions no outside food/drinks inside. A nice place to grab a quick bite to-go if needed. When we went it took about 20 minutes to get our food.
pos	A great place for authentic Japanese cuisine. The staff is very friendly and the fish is very fresh. I eat here often in one of my book groups. Please note that if you arrive around lunchtime during the school year it can look like there is a line out the door BUT that is usually Paly Students getting a takeaway lunch. Just respectfully push past them and put your name on the list for a table and the wait is usually short~10 minutes
neu	Good experience. Will share more details next visit. I need to check something.
pos	This place is AMAZING. I’m sitting outside at a picnic table after finishing the most delicious sushi I’ve had in a while. So reasonably priced, I ate a meal for two kings for the price of one. The staff was kind and amazingly polite, made us feel right at home, was so prompt with their service too! As for the food, the salmon sashimi was the thickest slab of fish I’ve ever seen in my life and it was just as tasty as it looked. The avocado rolls were PACKED with perfectly ripe avocados. I envy the folks that live close enough to visit this place regularly, it DEFINITELY needs more customers and love!!!
pos	Delicious sushi at affordable prices with outstanding service, outdoor seating or takeout. My favorite sushi place in the area
pos	Nice place. ;) It’s not my favorite, but definitely worth checking out. The gyoza is amazing. It is really crispy and it isn’t too sweet or too salty. The dragon roll is also pretty good too. As I said, this place is worth checking out!!!
pos	The good options are costly, and I suspect the fish isn't the freshest avaliable
pos	Been coming here since I was a little kid, and it’s stayed a favorite place for our whole family for decades now! Really lovely people; the service is always good, even when they’re slammed. The bentos, chicken salad, and udon are delicious (though can’t speak to the sushi as I’ve never had it).
pos	This is our go-to place for sushi -- very fresh, very well-prepared, generous portions, good seasonal variety, and totally reasonable prices.  We have tried other places (some that are much more expensive) in the vicinity and keep coming back to Sushi House because of the freshness and careful preparation. Table service is friendly, efficient.  During the dinner hour it is often crowded, so we usually get takeout if we are more than 2-4.  I take all the loyal customers as a sign of good food, well-made.   So glad to have this place in the neighborhood!
pos	I'm getting emotional just thinking about this place. This was one of the few authentic, down to earth Japanese restaurants in the extremely snobbish and overpriced town of Palo Alto. Given the lack of affordable and authentic Asian food in the area, I am so grateful Sushi House was an option for delicious, hearty bento boxes. Quality is on par with Yayoi for around 60% of the cost.
pos	This is my favorite take out sushi place in Palo Alto. It always tastes great, the price is good (around 5$ for standard rolls, 10$ for special rolls) and the staff is friendly. The restaurant itself is very small and simple - cafeteria style tables and chairs, bright white light... so I would not recommend this for a romantic dinner. But for lunch or take out it's the best!
pos	Awesome sushi and food here. The service is awesome. This is a nice gem of town and country. Sometimes the place can be busy, but I haven't had an issue getting a table. I recommend their hand rolls! Brown rice is an option too.
pos	Has very good, delicious Sushi. Lots of vegetarian options. The ambience, though not excellent, is pretty good -- I would bring a date here. My only complaint regarding the food is that they do not always provide as much picked ginger as they should with the Sushi. Other than that, the food gets two thumbs up from me.
pos	Absolutely perfect sushi 🍣🍣 Simple, fresh, and very reasonably priced. Everything you need and nothing you don't, my favorite place in all of Palo Alto ♥️
neu	nly ordered the spicy tuna sushi and the Philly sushi. For how much they cost I would order the spicy tuna again. The Philly sushi sucked and I love Philly roles.  Too much cream cheese imo to the point it just tasted like cream cheese. If I want sushi but don't want to pay a whole lot I'm definitely going here because 13$ for 16 sushi is pretty good for these parts
neu	We ordered sushi ahead of time and they said it would take 20 min. It took them 45 min and there was no one there. Also the spider roll looked like a spider which I’ve never wanted my food to look like a spider. Sushi was fine.
pos	Our go to "to-go." Sashimi is fresh and the service is dependable!
pos	I think I've been here at least 400 times now and I've been coming here regularly for almost two decades.  The food is good and the prices are reasonable.  The bento boxes are great for kids.  It's also good for takeout.
neg	TODAY My young daughter bought a sushi roll to-go from this shop ON HER LUNCH BREAK. They gave it to her in a box. She went back to her school (Palo Alto High) and opened the box AND ALMOST CHOKED TO DEATH - BECAUSE THIS DISGUSTING SHOP PUT THE WASABI AND THE GINGER IN THE SAME BOX WITHOUT USING A CONTAINER CUP. MY DAUGHTER INGESTED A LARGE AMOUNT OF WASABI WHICH GOT MIXED WITH THE ROLE. SHE MISSED HER CLASS AND THREW UP  THEY NEVER ASKED HER IF SHE WANTED THESE EITHER.  THIS IS THE MOST DISGUSTING POSSIBLE BEHAVIOUR AND DISRESPECT TO A YOUNG CUSTOMER. THIS PLACE CLEARLY HAS NO MORALS. THEY JUST WANT TO HAVE MONEY.  I SEE MANY 5 STAR REVIEWS BY PEOPLE THAT HAVE VERY FEW TOTAL REVIEWS - THOSE ARE MOST LIKELY FAKE REVIEWS.  I WILL GO TALK TO THE OWNER TOMORROW WITH MY ATTORNEY. DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO USE THIS PLACE. IT SHOULD BE BOYCOTTED.
pos	Been going here for over 8 years. Top quality sashimi and always a consistant service. Servers here remember you and how you like your food. Food comes out super fast as well.
pos	* Must-try dishes: - Unadon: It is delicious and has substantial Unagi. - Bento Box Combo: Nothing can be better than choosing two different main dishes in a single bento box when feeling starved at night. - Chicken Karaage: It tastes tender and juicy even being deep fried.  * Cost: $15~25/person  * 4-star reason: Sushi house is not a fancy Japanese restaurant, but it is definitely a great and cost-effective restaurant. It may always be forgotten since it is not in a very popular area, but a good choice for Stanford students if you feel reluctant to drive far for food.
neu	It's the definition of average sushi, in a decent place and ok service. The rice, miso soup, and fish (although fresh) were average at best. The bento boxes weren't appealing and the meat in one of them wasn't good at all. The Chirashi was a good portion of rice and sashimi. This place is well located in a campus area, affordable by students; wouldn't survive in, say, Santana Row. Unless I have nothing else to eat around, I doubt I'd come back to this place.
neg	The sushi was below average, the place wasn't the cleanest (especially the back and bathroom area) and it was comparatively a bit expensive. The host (seemed like the owner) was not friendly but the waiter was nice. I don't recommend this place and won't be visiting again.
pos	Go here almost every day for lunch. Quick to go meals and can get pricey but I think its worth. Love the beef teriyaki and assorted tempura bento box or the unadon. Only problem is the line during lunch.
neu	I have to be very honest - everything I have tried here was below average (and expensive!). I even prefer Cardinal Sushi, that delightfully decent hole-in-a-wall, to here. This place reminds me of Sushi88 in Mountain View, but that one is much better. No idea why it has 4.1 stars.
pos	Always consistently good food and service. Our go to place for down home Japanese cuisine.
pos	Great sushi. Decided to try it out and was very happy. They have 6 piece cheap rolls or large decorated rolls!
pos	great budget choice for sushi in Palo Alto.  The sushi rolls are good.  This place gets busy with take out orders as well as budget minded sushi eaters.  come early.
pos	Love their chicken udon, you get a generous portion of spinach, beautifully char grilled chicken, and perfect noodles. This place is it and the staff are kind.
pos	My go-to place for Japanese bento.  Fresh sushi, delicately grilled fish, yummy salad, with excellent portions at a reasonable price.  Ignore the decor and go for the food.
neg	Bad service. Gave us wrong check for $37 dollars with someone else's order, you could not tell from the check what item cost what.  Out order was for $17. Stuff are too busy and everyone rushes, even thought it was not so many people on Sunday noon. I also forgot my latte on the table that I just picked up from Peets, since I was confused about the check and trying to figure it out, and they just threw it away, even though we were still there.
pos	This place is clean the service is friendly and fast and the food is fresh.  Definitely check this place out if your looking for a good sushi restraunt
pos	A little on the pricey side but the size of the portions definitely surprised with how generous they were. The dishes were prepared well and seasoned excellently.
pos	Love sushi! This place is has good seating. Food was good. Service was nice and good spot for dinner.
pos	I took out California rolls and they tasted very good. The casher (seems like owner- who does not speak good English) was extremely unkind.
pos	Fresh an affordable. A little gem tucked into the back of the Town & Country Mall complex. Usually crowded, and sometimes a wait, but worth it for no frills sushi.
pos	very good. probably one of the best in the area. very long wait time. but you can order and eat outside which is much faster. friendly service.
pos	Good food. Nice staff.  They seemed to prioritize pickup orders and we waited over 45 minutes for a table.
pos	Excellent sushi, sashimi and tempura.  My spouse loves the chinese chicken salad and gyoza.
pos	My favorite Sushi place in the Bay Area.
neu	Good for lunch with decent, but not great sushi.  Not bad for a quick bite and convenient to meet people.
neu	Severs were nice, food was 4/5, there was just one roll that was just off and that was the Nagahami.
pos	Great food and they are super friendly. We ordered at the store and just waited 10 minutes.
pos	My favorite sushi place! Everything is so delicious and the staff is always friendly
pos	Food was good. Service was quick. The tables were kind of crowded. But I would definitely recommend it if you're in town and country.
pos	I really like this place and come here a lot. Food is great, and servers are very nice. Strongly recommend it.
pos	Pretty good udon noodles, and quick to get our food. I liked the food very much, but could be slightly pricy sometimes
pos	Good sushi at reasonable prices and never too crowded at early dinner times. Friendly staff as well.
pos	Good, cheap sushi. Be prepared to wait for a table if you go during prime time
pos	Very nice waitress, very understanding and accommodation for our requests. Would definitely recommend this place to others and would come here again.

neu	Great food and friendly staff, but they don't always do a good job managing tables and their wait list.
pos	Favorite sushi go to place. The chirashi bowl is awesome!
pos	The green salad is large, lots of avacado and a great miso dressing.
pos	One of the few places where I can get a grilled salmon roll. Love it.
pos	Great cheap tempura.  Like the kind youd get in a neighborhood joint in tokyo.
neg	Basic selection of sushi options, Service was okay, and space was limited.
pos	This place is so good that if it ever closes I'm quitting my phd.

pos	hello Masa san, as they are, I am Carlos Rangel, I hope you remember me. The best thing that happened to me in my life was to have worked with you. I wish you were well like me here in Mexico with my wife and my son. Since I got many memories to see where I work, also with the people I was working because when we had a lot of work we are stressed especially jairo, July and the stressful Lili and tell her that my wife zuleyka sends greetings to Lili.  medespido sending a sincere greeting to everyone for Reco san, the baby and his wife.
pos	It is quietly located on the side of the mall, but I really enjoyed the eel sushi. It was a bit expensive, but it was a good taste. 
pos	Good food 
pos	Epic AF
pos	Wooooow
pos	Very good 
neg	The food tastes very bad because it is far too sugary. The "Vietnamese hot chicken box" has cubed chicken breast slathered in extremely sweet sauce. It tastes like nothing that has ever touched the nation of Vietnam. You can't taste the chicken at all underneath all the sugar.
pos	Perfect for quick bite.... Must try their chef signature box. Fresh, healthy, taste, customer service,  location value of money, parking, 5/ 5*
neg	First, we tried to order online but that was capability was not working and the website did not have pricing, which was inconvenient. Found out upon ordering in person that this place is VERY overpriced:/ I’ve never spent $12-17 per person on a small hotbox. Shrimp were tiny and my meal felt more like a snack. Also, $12 for 2 mini spring rolls????! Are you kidding me?!! We will NOT be back.
neu	9-25-21: Stopped by for lunch before the UCLA vs Stanford football 🏈 game. Tried the Vietnamese hot 🔥 chicken 🐔 and was disappointed. Tasted like they poured that Thai sweet chili sauce over the dish... the kind you get at an Asian market.  If I wasn't so hungry, I think I would not have liked it as much... Not sure if I would be back OR I would try something different.
pos	Asian Box is a solid meal you can feel confidant will be the same each time.  Find the item(s) you like and know you can get that every time you order.  My go-to is the green curry with chicken.  Moderately spicy, good flavor, and a good bit of food to boot.
pos	First time having pho and this is by far the most rich broth ❤️🥰 love the noodles and the toppings of grace shop. Friendly services and the food was quick didn't wait for long for the food.
pos	I love Asian Box! I would eat here for dinner every night if I could. They have tons of healthy options and at a reasonable price for the Palo Alto area. I ordered takeout twice from Asian Box and got the salmon salad both times (it has Roasted Lemongrass Salmon, Baby Greens, Pickles, Sprouts, Crispy Shallots, and Ginger-Citrus Soy Vinaigrette). My husband prefers to build his own salad, but we both enjoyed our food! Tasty, fresh, healthy, and full of delicious veggies. I would recommend this to anyone looking for Asian street food near Stanford campus.
pos	This place is amazing! It's one of my favorite restaurants. I almost always get the shrimp box with everything but the jalapenos. It's also great because it is 100% gluten free, and i'm gluten free
neg	WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!  Our family chose Asian Box after reading ALL of the 5 star ratings. We were convinced that this was going to be a great dinner choice and infact it was one of the worse.  My daughter does NOT like peanuts! Her order specifically did NOT include peanuts, her meat choice was chicken. Upon getting our boxes as we ordered and went home, my daughters box had peanuts in them and another order had been screwed up. They switched the orders around. I didn't get to eat what I had ordered. After trying to eat and just forget about the mess up my daughter and I both could not enjoy our meal. Such a diservice to locals like us who frequent that plaza almost daily. We couldn't just go back, Asian Box closes at 9pm and we would have just wasted more time of a problem they created.  The shrimp spring roll is $5. It is actually one whole spring roll that is cut into two pieces. The dipping sauce was ridiculously spicey we all ended up discarding $15 dollars down the drain along with the other two orders that were screwed up.  This place is pricey and I personally wont dine here again, but if you choose to dine here, be cautious of how your order is handled. If you are someone who cannot ingest spicey sauces, skip the sauce on the spring rolls.
pos	Stopped by the Palo Alto location for lunch. My son and I were very satisfied with our orders. I had the Salmon.
pos	Great little place. Great build your own meal. High quality ingredients. Fast service. Little spendy, but isn’t everything nowadays?
pos	Imagine yourself, it's SF quarantine, 2020. The date? 4/11/20. Almost some sort of confidence, but far from it. My destiny in life was to devour this delicious meal. Do yourself a favor, eat here before we all take the long nap. Order online for easy pickup. Pristine sanitation, courteous staff, outdoor seating available for essential business Tinder dates...
neg	Fast food to go with sitting area. Select rice variety or noodles, topping choices, sauce choices. This is probably good for children who like predicability in their food choices. A good indication of how great a place is is whether you finish everything in your to-go box. The food is not that interesting or innovative, nor really enticing. But, it's a safe bet.
neu	I was really excited to go in-person in ordering Asian Box since I would frequently order through doordash. I was greeted at the door but the service I was provided from the cashier was really off. As I was ordering, she didn’t seem like she wanted to be there and annoyed with me when I asked for extra lids/plastic bag. Maybe she was having a bad day? Regardless, I maintained my respect and politeness.  The soy and garlic steak was super good though! I appreciated the tamarind sauce on top because it wasn’t too spicy. Thank you!
neu	The staff was very friendly and welcoming. However, the food itself is overpriced, a little bland, and not fresh. I got the tofu rice wrap which consisted of 2 miniature halves of 1 roll, some sauce, and plain salad leaves for $4.95. When I started eating, I was disappointed by the stiff rice wrap and the wilting veggies inside the box and the wrap. My friend got the chicken noodle soup which was alright, but not very authentic nor special.
pos	The menu shown in google is different from what you have in the store.  Which is bad if you're looking for a particular dish that they don't sell.
pos	I go to this place a lot for their nutritious food. Usually it tastes really good but depending on what I get the meal can be a bit too small and occasionally they have too salty and dry chicken. I'd say 80% of the time they're great and 20% of the time they're sub-par for the price.
neg	Horrrrriiibbbbbllleeeee experience as I waited 25 minutes for a sandwich that was basic . The place is completely empty why am I waiting this long?? Can you see all the staff standing around doing nothing!?!  I watched 4 people come in and order and leave! Even a door dash 😂😂 came and went. I will never go back not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin. I'm sad by my experience because I heard great things about here and write food blogs about new start up. I will NOT be adding this to my list. I will give the benefit of the doubt and try another location where customer service and good experience might mean something 🙄
pos	Firey Red Curry with brown rice, no peanuts, tufu mixed with shrimp.. Yummy... and followed directions no utensils or peanuts..
neu	Great menu. Fast service. Flavorful sauces.  Cooked Veggies need some al dente lovin’. The broccoli was gross and mushy. Just like mom made and we hated.
pos	My fave food! The best shallots in town! This box is vegan, vegetarian and out of this world good! Ps, get extra sauce 😜 it's that good!
neg	I drove across town for the poke bowl listed on the menu for this location.  Not available and the cashier dismissed it saying that they never had it. I asked her to pass on my concern to her manager and she looked at me as I was stupid and wrong for not accepting the misadvertising. She told me to just down the road to another place that may have it. Again not nicely or empathetically. Not a big deal but very gen z. More like if I didn't know her menu, she wasn't about to help.
pos	Quick, tasty, healthy. Easy online ordering.
pos	What a great spot to eat. Clean, fresh, healthy and delicious. They also do a lot of outreach and provided our wonderful caregivers free meals for our holiday party. Truly an amazing restaurant.
pos	Positively surprised by how delicious my bowl was!! I got the workout one with double chicken (extra $4.99 which I thought was really pricey) but the portion was generous, tasted freshly made and delicious. The guy who took my order was also extremely nice - will be back soon!
pos	100% gluten free menu. The banh mi was delicious. They make their own bread. The smoked pork in the sandwich tasted delicious.
pos	I adore their Garden Box. The flavors and the portion are just right!! Would recommend getting it at a catering event.
pos	My favorite place for lunch.  It's really set up for efficiency, but you can sit and eat inside or outside.  The food is literally as good as many  4-5 star restaurants.  They start with the highest quality ingredients and execute their recipes to near perfection.  My favorite is the Ox-Box, but I change it up quite a bit.  The staff is pleasant and hardworking.  They always greet me with a smile, and recognize me when I come in for order-ahead pickup.  They try hard and it shows.  I'm here at least once a week, but today was my second day in a row.
pos	We tried 3 menu options and all were fresh and delicious. Happy to see so many gluten-free options. Fast service, sanitizer, and one-way traffic in store.
pos	If you want healthy and delicious(usually they don't get along) food, go there. Every of the boxes is good! I specially like the Thai one.  Remember to order online and do pick up. They can be super busy (seriously busy). Not many seats so prepare to find a place nearby and enjoy your meal.
pos	If you haven't tried Asian Box yet, you MUST! Their boxes are fully customizable, allowing for people to easily adjust for dietary restrictions/preferences. For me, I am a vegan who prefers gluten-free options. Luckily, there are plenty of choices for vegans and meat-eaters alike, plus they are all gluten-free.  I have been going to Asian Box once a week since I first discovered them 4-years ago. Their quality and attention-to-detail have only increased since I tried my first box. I am so thankful to have healthy-ish/flavorful experience to await me at the end of each week.  Thank you, Asian Box! <3
neg	$14 for a burned, hard as a rock, yet still soggy Bahn Mi sandwich. Just awful.
pos	I had one of the greatest experiences today at Asian Box. The gentleman at the register went above and beyond and really made my day a lot better.  As always the food was great, and I got a Vietnamese iced coffee to finish the day strong
pos	Tasty, good value snack - I had the chicken curry with peanut sauce. It was freshly prepared, a decent portion size for the price, and ready within a few minutes. Staff were also very friendly and helpful.
pos	Basically international Chipotle. Order the Garden Box with Jalapeños.
pos	Asian Box is a family favorite as everyone can get exactly what they want. The kids box is the perfect portion for my kids, 3 & 7, and the adult portion leaves me full. As someone who is following a Keto lifestyle there are a lot of options here for me which is great. The food is always fresh and tasty and is ready quickly.
pos	Very nice selection of ingredients. Various proteins are nicely spiced. Always round out the meal with a Vietnamese coffee!
pos	The food here is absolutely incredible. It’s fresh and every box is expertly crafted. I’ve had almost of them and they are spectacular. The Ox box and the Chicken curry box are to die for. The service is also incredible. They are always friendly and accommodating with a smile.
pos	Quality California Style Asian food at a great price. Got a lemongrass pork box and it was tasty and filling. Not out of this world tasty. But clean/healthy and it hit the spot. Would definitely come back again.  Updated from 4 to 5 stars: I've probably been here 15 times since this review. Amazing value, and taste. I think this chain could be as popular as Chipotle if they can scale right.
neg	Had a bit of a bad experience here. It's a modern, fast-food-like spot, and you get your food fast. Only problem was that I got the shrimp box and mine weren't quite defrosted from the freezer- really didn't help the meal.  I like the customization features and it's quite cheap and quick, but the overall taste is not that great, and they murdered the box with Sriracha (which I usually love). Girlfriend got the beef bowl which was a bit better, but still nothing special.  I might give it another shot as I'm hoping that the shrimp issue was a one-time thing, but my first experience was not very good.
pos	Really accommodating for those who have dietary restrictions! Gluten free, nut free, etc! Nice spot if you have a friend who is on a strict diet! Not too expensive! Around $10-15! Has some nice outdoor seating but sometimes covered in caterpillars in the spring hahaha.
pos	This is the first time I have stepped into this Asian Box in Palo Alto or ever and I have to say this place is awesome! They greet every guest, the environment is very welcoming, and they are very helpful for you new comers. Plus the food tastes good!!! I was hungry and very glad I came here, no disappointment here.
neu	The food is mediocre, and wait times are not ideal
pos	Super healthy, efficient and consistently great food. Love the Garden Box without tofu. Would like to be able to order online a custom box without protein but unfortunately it is not an option.Maybe cleaning the buzzers with a bleach wipe between each customer would be good too. We go here everyday for lunch, it opens away 11am and is super busy with catering, doordash and grubhub.. 10/10
pos	I love Asian Box! They have so many options for everyone, including vegans and vegetarians! I recently got the Garden Box, which comes with extra tofu for just 20 cents more. It's a good "House Favorites" (in fact, all of them are good) but you can customize your box! So many options! Plus, their drinks are good as well. I love the Vietnamese coffee!
neg	Food was overpriced compared to the quality and portion sizes (even by Palo Alto standards). Waitstaff were rude and pretended not to hear me when I asked them where the nearest available toilet was.
pos	I love that I can eat everything here! I can’t eat gluten so that is a rare thing for me. Asian Box is always my first stop in California. The cookies are also amazing! I love the salad with chicken and the pho soup the best. Please open a store in Seattle!
pos	Quick, good food. We always enjoy Asian Box. You choose your protein, salad/rice, toppings and sauce. The kids box is good, rice small portion of veg (cabbage/broccoli/carrot) which can be removed and kids always remark on how tender the chicken is. They usually pick the caramel sauce which can come on the side. there are tables outside. The line is usually at its longest at 12 when the high school students come for their lunch.
pos	So good. I don't have many options in our hometown for gluten-free Asian food. When we are down at Stanford, we always stop to eat and get extras for the road. I love Vietnamese food and don't always have the time to make it. This is a huge treat and is a great place for Celiacs and others with food allergies or sensitivities.
pos	Delicious asian quick food without being too unhealthy. Don't miss their crispy shallot, fresh herbs toppings and peanut sauce. They are absolute yummy. Make sure to get hot-box-it on the side as it is really hot. Although food is little on expensive side and seating is not that great, it was overall a great experience.
pos	Good on the go "healthy" Asian food. They are kind of like chipotle as you pick your rice, noodles, or salad followed by what meat you want followed by which toppings, and finally what sauce you desire. The staff is friendly and the food comes out quickly. The beef is the way to go in my opinion, tender and flavorful.
pos	Tons of options! The boxes have a lot of variety with meat and veggies and it pairs really well. Sodas are a bit expensive. I ate here with a group and they got one of our orders wrong, and so they remade it, and let us keep the old order as well, no questions asked. Parking, however, is a nightmare during the lunch rush.
neg	While I thought the meal was decent enough (probably 3-4 stars on their own merit, the chicken was delicious), I was disappointed when I opened up my takeout box 15 minutes later and realized that the coconut peanut sauce I had paid .75 cents extra for was not there at all. Combined with my girlfriend's egg being left off her order, it's hard to imagine me going back to same location for a while, although the concept is sharp and I hope they continue to improve.
pos	Nice fast meal. During lunchtime on a weekday, they get incredibly busy with all the additional doordash orders -- almost overwhelmingly so. It's worth it to order ahead online for pick up. If not, you will be waiting about 15 minutes for your food if you just walk in.
pos	I placed an online order for Asian Box in Mountain View only to find when I arrived they were closed for July 4th.  I called Palo Alto Asian Box, explained my circumstances and they came up with a great suggestion to pick up food there.  They were awesome, creative and thoughtful!!!
pos	Pretty good quick lunch option. The food is fresh and tasty.
neg	The staff was friendly and place clean. The portions are good sized but what little meat you do get is very tough and dried out.  Picking out items you want still can't overcome the very tough inedible meat.
neg	The food's okay, but the last 3 times I've ordered online there has been a problem with my order. My most recent experience was I ordered through Google's search page (via Postmates), and when I showed up to pick up my order they had no record of it. I've also tried calling in my order in the past and the call just goes to voicemail. I won't be getting food from Asian Box again because it's just too hard to submit an order.
pos	Good people/service. Fresh food. They never mind customizing EXACTLY as you want it. Just a pleasant experience all around, everytime. If you don't have a lot of time to eat but want well prepared, fresh food this is your new joint.
pos	Always quick, tasty and inexpensive. The only place in bay that used qtips for touchscreens during pandemic.
neu	Fresh, tasty food, gluten-free, and tons of flexibility - the food and concept get 5 stars.  Minus two stars for execution - we've mostly stopped going because you spend so much time waiting behind Doordash / OrderAhead orders. Either rate limit these services, drop one of them, or open a separate kitchen to serve them; I don't go to a quick service restaurant to wait an extra 20 minutes for a bunch of take-out orders (worse - you can't even judge the wait by looking at the line, due to said take-out orders)
pos	I... LOVE this place! The concept is not original but the food is delicious! Everything is gluten-free and you get many choices to customize your box. You can't really go wrong with any of the options because they all taste great together. As someone who has been trying to eat healthy after the holidays but doesn't want the food to *taste* too healthy, this is the perfect place.  First you choose a base (choice of jasmine rice, brown rice, asian salad, rice noodles) and then a meat (pork, chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu). I went with the asian salad for the extra veggies and the beef. You automatically get wok sauteed veggies (or you can opt for steamed) and other veggie toppings such as picked carrots, bean sprouts, etc. My box was literally an explosion of yummy veggies. And of course you get to choose your sauce. I went with the tamarind, but I'm sure the other sauces are delicious too.  Tl;dr tasty healthy box of veggies and meat.
neg	I ordered Miss Jones but got rice instead of noodles
pos	I consider this place as the chipotle of Asian food, in a good way, not authentic but still very tasty. They don't operate with the production line efficiency of chipotle. They let you pick the ingredients and choice of very yummy sauces. Lots of vegetarian choices.
pos	Vietnam style box. Very nice! I'm so full ha-ha
pos	Walked in for a to-go box of pork and brown rice with wok veggies and some toppers, and tried both the tamarind and sriracha sauces. I liked tamarind the best but next time will probably try some others. Good flavor, right-sized portions, definitely an option for a fast, fresh lunch or dinner.
pos	Taste great, fast and kind service, and has great location with outside sitting
pos	If you love the culinary excellence of The Slanted Door in San Francisco and the ease of Chipotle dining, then Asian Box is your new go-to restaurant. The concept is simple- select a base (rice, salad, or noodles), choose your protein (tofu, chicken, pork, beef, shrimp), add desired veggies and toppings, and finish it off with a sauce (hint: always go with the peanut sauce).  I love Asian Box because I know the ingredients are fresh and sourced locally. The gourmet-fast food is healthy and paleo and gluten-free friendly! Bay Area locations currently exist in Palo Alto, Mountain View, and SF.
neg	Nice place with friendly stuff. However, the food was  boring -  very poor taste. They just put ingredients you pick on a paper plate and serve it to you, forgetting to make a dish out of it. It misses the Asian style blend of flavors. Additionally, the portions are rather small.
pos	Food: 4 Decor: 4 Service: 4  Came here for lunch with a friend around 12:20pm on a weekday.  Got jasmine rice with chicken and caramel egg, with vinaigrette and sriracha on the side, $9.  Overall, not bad, but I would have preferred more chicken, and they forgot my friend's sauces.
pos	Delicious food that's celiac-friendly (dedicated gluten-free kitchen) any that both kids and adults will enjoy. A small, local chain that is groaning for a reason.
pos	Tasty food! I love the shrimp and chicken here and the peanut sauce is definitely a must-have! My only complaint are the portions as they are not as big as I'd hope for for the price I'm paying.
pos	Awesome fresh vibrant food. Love it. Highly recommend it. Am a vegetarian and I generally found little option and accommodation with Vietnamese food so was very excited to find this place.  Try it out, you'll likely not be disappointed!
neg	Don't buy the family box, the image on the menu is just a scam. It's supposed to be for 4-6 people but there is hardly enough meat in it for 2. I would give a half star if that was possible cause this place does not even deserve 1 star.
neu	My second time here because of convenience. I like the concept and approach but it certainly does not reminiscence of street food flavor nor the quantity. Kinda small portions of everything and light on flavor profile. Food is ok but nothing exciting for $10 bucks. I want you guys to succeed being a sbo myself. Best wishes!!  👊👊👊👊
neu	As far as fast casual goes, Asian Box is a good choice. Depending on what you add on, each bite will be a variety of different flavors. Lime, jalapeno, hot sauce, and more. A little expensive for what you get, but packs a punch.
pos	Fantastic tasting food that leaves you feeling revitalized! Quick, easy to customize, and lots of choices. Also a dedicated gluten free facility, for those who have gluten sensitivities.
pos	Thank you to Asian Box for great service tonight. I was starving after my flight and wanted something healthy and refreshing. It was open until 9 after Thanksgiving which I give big kudos to them since I'm sure it's not easy to be open after a holiday. Thank you so much!
pos	Awesome concept. Quick and amazingly delicious food. Every combination is really good, but my go-to sauce is Miss Jones' Sriracha. Always always add the caramel egg
pos	This is similar to chipotle for Asian food. They have good selection of food. Great taste. Great vegetarian options. You can get mild to very spicy options. Prices are great compared to other places in this area.
pos	Healthy tasty food and friendly service. They employ local students and train them well. I always know someone working there. Everything is served compostable or recyclable  containers. They are doing everything right.
pos	Asian Box makes really delicious and fast Asian fusion food. I've been here so many times because they're so consistent with their food.  This restaurant is somewhat like advanced Chipotle for Asian foods. There are certainly a lot more choices to choose.  Here's what I recommend:  Base: Chilled Rice Noodles because the brown rice and jasmine rice are a bit plain in comparison. However, this is the least important choice since the rest of the ingredients easily drown out the base.  Meat: Go with your favorite. Beef, shrimp, and chicken are my favorites.  Topps: You MUST get the crispy shallots. They are amazing. I like them just as much as I love the legendary grilled onions from Liba Falafel. I also recommend the chopped peanuts, bean sprouts, and scallion oil. Skip the caramel eggs.  Sauce: I recommend mixing Peanut Sauce and Miss Jones' Sriracha. It's the perfect blend, and it's not too spicy. Tamarind Vinaigrette + Peanut Sauce and No-Oil Fish Sauce + Peanut Sauce are also great combos. In fact, you just can't go wrong mixing Peanut Sauce with anything.  The Palo Alto location for Asian Box has been open much longer than the Mountain View location. I've found that service is slightly better in their MV location, and building there looks better too.
neg	All you get is a lot of rice and little entree. A disgrace to vietnamese cuisine. Never returning and not recommend to anyone.
neu	The food is great but this location has a major vibe problem.  The inside is very cramped and when it gets busy, it's just loud and uncomfortable.  The cashiers yelling, "Welcome to Box!" doesn't feel welcoming at all.
pos	Shaving Bahn Mi sandwiches with GF bread my friends... I wish I lived here so I could eat this every single day. Bless you Asian Box!
neg	Just had the worst banh mi sandwich I've ever had. Zero flavor. Do yourself a favor and stay away from their terrible banh mi.
neg	I use to Deliver the meat to this location. I couldn't believe how dirty the prep area was. They need to step up there cleaning game.
pos	Satisfying asian inspired chipotle style rice and/or noodle bowls served up pretty fast. I like the options of sauces and proteins (which include shrimp), but wish there were a few more veggie options.
pos	Fabulous place to grab a quick bite. Healthy, very friendly staff, and get your protein and veggies just the way you want them. Yummm
pos	Simple yet tasty meals with lots of variety, sizeable potions, and very reasonable pricing. A personal standby when I need some relatively healthy food on the weekends.
neg	Their photos all have pho, but they don't sell pho. False advertising
neg	The blond lady in the cashier is so rude and disrespectful to delivery drivers. With this unprofessional service cant expect much of a taste
neg	Rice boxes are amorphous mounds devoid of character, structure and taste. I can approximate the look and taste of this very well by tossing all my Asian leftovers together.
pos	Was delish last night. Headed there again today. 😎
pos	Curry tofu is my favorite option
neg	Their curry is far too spicy and a few bites made me very sick. They need to offer spicy levels.
neg	Spectacularly inconsistent. Today the staff left out the sauce (again) and the pork was cooked to death :(
pos	Stopped in for a quick bit of Vietnamese comfort yums at Asian Box in Palo Alto. Shrimp spring roll and iced coffee hit the spot!
pos	The people were super nice and let us come in and order right as they were closing, also the food was really good. Great place for people who need to eat gluten-free.
pos	Asian Box is very delicious. I often like to put the tamarind vinaigrette on my box. However, whenever I get the beef, I often find it to be slightly undercooked.
pos	Got the salad box with steak to-go.  The food was fabulous - beyond my expectations.  Staff were kind, good, and hardworking.
pos	Nice food
pos	Really yummy vegan box with Tofu and brown rice. I was traveling and ate here twice. Very friendly and fast service.
pos	Good, quick food. The drinks (especially the coffee) are especially tasty. Not cheap but pretty reasonable by Palo alto standards
pos	Great place for quick bite. Veggie tofu option as well. Great taste and fresh healthy food. Great price too.
pos	Delicious food, all gluten free, and an incredible value.  The staff is also very friendly and enthusiastic.
pos	Food is fresh and service is efficient. It would be nice if the portion is a little bit more.
neg	Not for coeliac people unfortunately :( I am gluten highly intolerant and dairy intolerant, I took a box with veggies and shrimps (and no sauce). It was fresh & yummy, but I can tell that it wasn't gluten free because it made me sick and I got both the stomac and skin reactions and that was the only new thing I had in my day.
neu	Warning: this place charges a 3% surcharge without informing you at the time of purchase. A shady business practice IMO.
pos	If you want quick, healthy, and delicious. Look no further than Asian box. Always a great call when you're hungry.
pos	Great restaurant for a quick clean meal. Asian fusion, tasty and tangy. Service was high quality overall great experience.
pos	Very solid food each time I've been. Good flavors, good quality ingredients.
pos	Interesting place. Kind of like Asian burrito bowls in that you can pick the protein and then other options such as sauce and egg.
pos	Had a great experience at this location. Food is very fresh and tasty. Staff is super friendly and helpful.
pos	This is a great place to grab some lunch or dinner-fresh and very filling (and big potions)! It’s good fast casual.
neu	Consistent and fast vietnamese food. Staff is not responsive to feedback and do not go above and beyond to exceed customer's expectations.
pos	Excellent,  best gluten-free food ever!
pos	Love me some Asian box. So many choices and everything is delicious AND gluten free, how could I not love it
pos	i like eating here, best i can describe is its like chipotle for asian food, i usually get cold noodles with steak and peanut sauce
pos	Delicious fresh food. A little expensive, but worth it. Be prepared to wait 10 minutes for it to be prepared.
pos	I love this place and the owner Wendy!! The food was healthy and delicious. Wendy just makes this place a home away from home.
pos	Delicious and a place I would go every other week. Small spot but worth the trip.
pos	I was a cook there about 6 years ago and I still come to eat the food is amazing.... welcome to the box.....!
pos	Quick, tasty, and seems healthy compared to more traditional fast food.
neu	7:30pm and the Asian box ran out of rice... Disappointing.  Vietnamese iced coffee is amazing though, I'd come back for that.
pos	Fresh and healthy food. A bit pricey but the staff is nice and service is fast
pos	Good food of a healthier variety
pos	It's one of our go-to places for a quick bite that's tasty. Love the lemonade drinks there too.
pos	Flavorful vegetarian dishes. Great meat options also. Very reasonably priced.
neu	Food is pretty underwhelming. Recommended by many friends but unfortunately was overpriced and not particularly good.
neg	Nasty food , under cooked and major overpriced
pos	I'd spend hours chowing down on Asian Box every night if I could.  Flavorful but not overwhelming.
pos	Very very busy order online for pick up or maybe even get it delivered. Place is very small but great food
neu	Healthy simple food. The portions aren't big, but the all natural food is refreshing.
pos	Very good food portions are very good and friendly staff.
pos	Fast, healthy(ish), great service. One of my lunch go-to's.
pos	Wow...tastiest place ever!!! The price was perfect, the staff efficient and very nice. So good!
pos	Fast Asian food from another chipotle inspired joint. Love the simplicity and efficiency
pos	Great place for a fast and convenient meal, prices are pretty good for the given area.
pos	Great food, good prices. Strongly recomended for families
neu	It was just alright. My carrots were raw. Carrots shouldn’t be raw in curry.
pos	Amazing food fast. Affordable and packed with veggies.
neu	Pretty average food. Large portion, but not much meat.
neg	Not real Vietnam food! Vietnamese food is 100 times better!
neu	Good food, slightly expensive, obnoxious greeting, and fairly slow
neg	Went here for a pick up and waited over 30 minutes for one meal. Ridiculous.
pos	Garden box is my favorite here.
pos	Good and plenty of food. Red curry was great.
pos	Nice little custom boxed meal with lots of delicious options.
pos	Awesomeness. Family Package Deal was Tastyyyyyyyyyyy

pos	As someone likes these climates, the food is good and served quickly
pos	Very good good food
pos	The very tasty spring rolls I recommend them 😋😋😋😋😋
pos	Excellent place to start
pos	Very rich food😉😉
pos	I went here for lunch and expected it to be busy and fortunately it wasn’t. The fries were the best part of the meal. So, so good. The person who took my order was so nice and helpful. I’m definitely coming back again. Thank you.
pos	This is easily the best hummus and food in general that I have had in a long time. The pita that came with the hummus was fresh and the perfect amount of chewy. After thinking that the meal couldn’t get any better, I tried the cabbage that came with it and was pleasantly surprised. I wish they had these where I live. I 100% recommend.
neu	Food is good, hot sauce is great, but they don't provide free water and want you to buy a bottle. It's a ridiculous practice. Won't be back. Their other location provides water. I guess I'll go there.  [update] happy to hear from the team responding. Updating star for listening to customers.
neg	Our meal was OK.  Flavors were good but for the price we paid and what are likely not too expensive ingredients the quality was not very good.  I had the chicken schnitzel pita sandwich.  The chicken was over done and tough. My wife had a falafel bowl which was mostly rice and light with 4-5 quite small balls of falafel.  We’ve had Oren’s catering which was excellent but this was a let down.
pos	We shared a Green Herb Falafel Plate with 2 white pita bread for a light lunch. The food was good to look at and even better to eat with fusion of flavors, great to taste and not reeking of garlic. We had to wait for over 20 minutes, initially got falafel and pita in a bag instead of food we ordered and the counter staff was overwhelmed. They need more staff and better service. We would love to keep going there.
pos	Excellent food. Parking can be a challenge but it's worth the effort. We ordered a Mongolian beef hummus bowl.  Just delicious and light.  You get plenty of pita bread and a delicious salad option. We had the Israeli salad which is cucumbers tomatoes red onions in a delicious light dressing.
pos	Just as yummy as the other Oren's in Palo Alto. Great location by Stanford. Quick service. Delicious falafel wrap. So many vegetarian choices. I have loved Oren's & now I love Oren's Express!
pos	Great Israeli Hummus, like at home in Israel! And a great playlist. The Sabiha wasnt the best but maybe because I get used to eat it in Pitta (and not next to)
neg	Their chicken plate, which I used to order all the time, went from $16 to $23 in the span of two weeks. I get inflation is tough but a 44% price increase at once makes no sense, and charging $23 for chickpeas and a scoop of chicken is just ridiculous even these days. I can’t justify going back - bummer because it used to be a favorite spot!
pos	Absolutely delicious!! Must try if you’re in the area and craving some hummus. Big portion sizes too.
pos	Hands down by far most athletic hummus I've ever tasted. I highly recommend buying extra to take home.
pos	Located in the Northwest corner of Town & Country by the train tracks. Really good hummus and warm pitas. This is more of a take out place, thus the “Express,” but there is outdoor seating.
neg	The sweet potato fries were salty and overcooked. It was like an old batch that was refried again. The whole meal that I ordered, which was the chicken plate shawarma came in very small portions in comparison to falafel stop in Sunnyvale. Simply overpriced.
pos	Very cool Express meal with everything included. Very fresh and flavorful meals.
pos	Nice staff. Ordered rice bowl, was pleasantly surprised by its delicacy.
pos	So far so good. Corporate management is at the location to watch overall operations. Food tasted very fresh. I believe it is its first fast food style location. There is only one big table inside. They have a lot of tables and chairs outside. They also offer $7.5 meal for students which is very nice. I like to go to a restaurant when it just opened. Food typically tastes at its best. It is the most important thing that they can keep up the same quality and taste. For now this location offers the beat taste hummus compared to other locations. Hopefully, it will remain the same.
pos	Fast, friendly service and delicious healthy mediterranean food! Only outdoor tables.
pos	Check out the shakshouka! They make a red and a green which are both are excellent.
pos	Their cauliflower bowl is the best for vegetarians. Even the beets bowl is good. Their red sauce is amazing. Food quality is very good and their portions are very big. Worth the money. Tasty and healthy!
pos	This is my absolute favorite place, if you are vegan, the falafel express plate is amazing with 3 different kinds of salad, hummus, falafel and pita bread! Also falafel sandwich and falafel rice bowl are amazing! The food is tasty and fresh! The restaurant is always super clean and organized but that’s not all! The guys that work there are amazingly sweet, polite and professional, they are always nice no matter what’s going on! All of them are super friendly and helpful!
pos	As of today it's a new shop and the staff was still a little unclear on the ingredient of the menu, but that'll get worked through soon enough.  Most important is that the food was excellent. The hummus was creamy and had tons of tahini. Falafels were crisp on the outside and moist inside.
neu	Pretty slow, kitchen seems disorganized. There was a big group of people waiting for their orders because they were running behind the estimates the order sites gave. Waited an extra 10 minutes
neg	This place is unreliable.  Sometimes the food is great, other times it tastes like it was made YESTERDAY.  Also, it's surprising this place is actually kosher -- what Rabbi certified this place?  Watch anyone in food prep and you will easily spot questionable hygiene practices.
pos	I absolutely love Oren’s! And the young man “SEAN” who took my order was SO friendly & professional! Unlike some of the Oren’s restaurants where the servers tend to lean on the grumpy side. This spot is delightful! Well done 🙌✅🙌
pos	I enjoyed their food and the service was very fast. Great for a pick me up. They also had many vegan and gluten-free options.
pos	One of my go-tos in Palo Alto. While the menu is more limited than the non-express Oren's Hummus, the food quality and service are above and beyond.
pos	Really like the moroccan beef bowl, the pita is light and fluffy, and they are fast. Price can be a little high, but what isn't in t&c
pos	Great quick easy to work with.  Staff was great and was helpful in all. Missed something in order but was quickly refunded.  Thank you for your quick serve
pos	Just opened and still working out some kinks, but overall a good rendition of the main restaurant. They had more options than I thought for an Express version and the food was ready quick and was tasty.
pos	I love middle eastern food. When I visited Jordan and Egypt this summer, it reminded me of the delicious food I had there and tasted just like the Middle East! Legit.
pos	good service, tasty food, a little pricey in my opinion for the amount of food you get (but like not surprising considering it's palo alto)
pos	Great food. I always visit it when I'm in the area. All the dips are scrumptious!
pos	Oren's has great hummus and the best pitas around. I recommend the morrocan beef hummus bowl
pos	Amazing food! This location is one of the best Oren’s Hummus’.
pos	Service has always been helpful and friendly. The store is very clean. The pitas are amazing!
neu	Good hummus get some and they forget to put my full order I called in and they said yes its here we forgot to put it in the bag ok then what I need it now not for tomorrow
pos	Healthy and filling falafel plate
pos	chicken and rice bowl never fails
pos	Super friendly and quick service with Oren's signature natural hummus on the fly. Definitely coming back.
pos	Great selection. Thanks for your hospitality...we are coming back again!
neg	The put all the Arabic food as Israeli food, so they’re lying
pos	Great food and service.
pos	Delicious, healthy, affordable!
pos	Best hummus ever!
pos	Great food .. loved it
pos	Fast and delicious!
pos	Grate hummus & Falafel
pos	Ginnie
pos	Great food
pos	Delicious humus dish had a lot but tasty
pos	Good portion size and fresh ingredients. The mango was ripe, the crab salad was tasty, and the fish tasted fresh. Great heart meal, even with just the medium size.
pos	If you’re in the area and itching for a bowl of Poke, this is a great spot to hit up. It’ll hit the spot (if you have one), and it’s a fair representation of the genre for the uninitiated.  The fish here is fresh. They give you lots of options for meats - I highly recommend the ahi tuna which is the most original form of poke. Their ponzu sauce was a delightful touch, and a reminder that good poke lets the taste of the fish shine through and keeps the sauce as an aside.  You’ll probably get your order in a to-go box because of the pandemic, which sucks because the rice sticks to the to-go box.
pos	Visited occasionally during Halloween. The bowl in fact surprisingly tasty and with good quality. Most importantly, super health and priced affordable. 5 stars.
pos	Delicious poke bowls and very large portion sizes which I did appreciate. Fresh seafood and a wide variety of toppings make for a great texture variety. Ordered off of Uber eats and their order printer was down so our order didn’t start to get processed for quite some time until they spotted us waiting and standing for 15 minutes. Once they started making the orders, it took them another 10 minutes to finish wrapping up the execution of the order but I would have appreciated a little bit more of a service recovery gesture for the delay. Staff was nice enough and the food was tasty.
neu	Food is good. Service is usually a bit if a challenge. Would be great if they offered gluten free soy sauce (tamari). The employee helping didn’t speak English well and didn’t seem to understand me when asking for GF soy sauce, and just pointed to the bowl of normal soy sauce.
neg	Unfortunatly the service was poor. When someone finally walked up to the counter for us to order, they didn't accept our in-person order and was told to order online instead, but they allowed the group behind us to order in-person. We waited over half an hour for our food, even though there was barely any customers, just to be served with food matching to their service.
pos	I like how they have a lot of topping options.  It was very good.
pos	Poke shops might be popping up everywhere, but Poke House is definitely on a tier of its own. It's my favorite poke place -- the ingredients are fresh, healthy, delicious and affordable given what you get!  They have great signature bowls to choose from, but I'm a build-your-own kind of person. I like the different bases you can choose from (sushi rice, brown rice, mixed greens and even zucchini noodles) and the various proteins from salmon, ahi tuna, pre-marinated spicy tuna (the more traditional poke way), scallops, octopus and also chicken (as a mom to a toddler who can't eat raw fish yet, I appreciate this option)  There are all sorts of toppings; they offer a crab salad for free but of course, adding avocado or seaweed salad comes at a small additional cost each (which is worth it given that you get half an avocado and a generous portion of seaweed salad).  Definitely check out this place to see for yourself! Whether it's on a lunch break at work, after getting groceries at Trader Joes, or coming from a workout nearby at Equinox or Soulcycle, Poke House is a great, balanced and yummy option.  Tip #1: If you need to jet earlier, they are also on DoorDash.  Tip #2: They have a digital loyalty card so make sure to add your phone number after check-in and get your stamps
pos	grand opening on jan 29. i've been a fan of Poke House so i'm stoked to see them open up in Palo Alto! great location inside town & country village. modern, spacious and clean inside. i ordered the house salmon signature bowl with brown rice.. and it was delicious! also ordered the nitro coffee (although i'm sure some of their fruit infused water would have done the job too!). owner was actually onsite that day. he mentioned that the salmon i was eating is sourced off the coast of Sweden. whoa thats cool. and the fish is cut fresh daily (they actually dont have freezers in the back which i was surprised to hear). i'll have to try some of the other toppings and sauces next time. i would definitely recommend poke house if ur craving some fresh, de-lish, filling poke bowls!
neu	Service wasn't the best thing... However, all ingredients are fresh and pretty good. I ordered custom Built-Your-Own. Two scoops of protein - Garlic Oyster Sauce Tuna was pretty tasty! Simple tuna with Lime Ponzu was so so. I usually like Masago but their Masago was a little bit fishy:( I liked Hijiki tho!
pos	The Poke bowl was amazing. They charged 2.50 for the miso soup, which was served in such a tiny cup. Honestly, this could have been provided for free or a max of 1.00 additional.
pos	Tasty place offering great portions, fast, friendly service. I really love the option of doing a bowl with fresh mixed spring greens in lieu of rice, which isn’t common in most poke places.
pos	Actually really good - portions are big even for the small bowl and the seafood is always rlly fresh
pos	Standard poke bowl place, no surprises. Good quality, nice portion size.
pos	One of the most bang for buck poke bowls I’ve had! I love that they give you a free scoop of crab salad. On top of that, the fish portions are so generous, sauces were also very delicious. What sets this place apart is that they offer masago and mango at no extra cost compared to other poke shops in the area, something that’s really important to me as a big fan of those two toppings!!  Would totally come back again, hope the quality and portions stay the same!
neg	simply awful!  the service provided by the employees is the worst, you arrive and they take a long time to look at your face, then they leave you waiting without any desire to work, the food is good but the service is terrible
pos	Yes it’s $15 a bowl - but the portions are massive. Everything was so fresh and tasty. Best poke bowl I’ve had!
neu	Flavor was not there a little bland tating and rice was not cooked properly.
pos	Love this place, recommend eating it nearby or at the location. When you door dash or order online and have it delivered, it gets warm and you can't consume it. I had a bad experience with door dash but again that's door dash not Poke House. Still love this place when I go over.
pos	Always great Poke, fresh.  Friendly and quick service.  We hit them up about once every 2 weeks, sometimes once a week.  It gives us our Sushi fix at a good price.  It's always busy, which is a testament to their popularity and good fish.  I usually get the spring salad base, and it is always fresh with no wilted greens (or purples).
pos	Poke house has the best selection of toppings and add-ons, by far. Everything here is super fresh. This is the only poke restaurant which I will come back to again and again
pos	If we're near Palo Alto and it's approaching lunch time, we always order ahead from Poke House for pickup. It's the best around. Lots of interesting ingredients like pineapple and walnuts. Yum!
pos	Perfect bowl. It’s expensive ($20) but there is enough to share.
neu	Come for the food, not the service. Ordered two tuna poke bowls online, took over 25 mins to make. About 10 mins past my pick up time. Multiple people outside not seemingly happy with their wait times either. Just make sure you give them ample time to scoop some pre prepared food into a bowl.
neu	Food is good. Price point is a little high. I feel like management could do a little better with their workers. I went one evening and there were abt 10 or so people waiting for their order. Inside, one worker was trying to prep all the orders while 4 other workers were talking and drinking. I felt sorry for the worker working alone. My order took about 45 mins to get to, and i was very satisfied, but i felt sorry for all the work that this one girl went through while the rest of the crew did nothing to help.
pos	So far best poke around here. Generous portions. Fresh and delicious.
pos	Delicious food, easy to customize every dish, good and friendly service
pos	This place is awesome. The fish quality is consistently great, the free crab scoop is really good, and the sauces are really flavorful and combine extremely well.  2 scoops is typically enough if you choose to stuff it with more veggies.
pos	Wow!  We love poke, and this reminds me of Hawaii every time! We ordered two salmon house specials with fresh greens for my wife and I, and how plentiful and tasty!  Definitely hit my umami taste buds. They give large portions, and the greens are fresh like I’m eating straight from a garden.  This time, my wife was so excited, she exclaimed, “It’s a burst of flavor that is exploding in my mouth!”  I couldn’t help but let out a chuckle.  We also ordered 3 handrolls which were perfect for my 18 month old toddler to hold, and she ate the whole thing!  We are quite hesitant to do take out during COVID, but this place has very high standards of cleanliness and presentation.  It’s one of the only places I trust during the COVID pandemic.   We love Poke House and I highly recommend this place!
pos	Great food, always fresh and tasty. Only issue was their new ordering system. I used to go there all the time and they would still let you order at the counter even during Covid times. Now they’ve started online only so if you show up, you have to scan at the door to order your food. Wouldn’t be a huge deal if it worked but seems to be a bit glitchy. Couldn’t add anything to my cart and I literally watched 4 other people come up, try to order, get frustrated and leave to go somewhere else in the marketplace as I did the same. Staff wasn’t helpful as it was a new system for them as well and they didn’t seem familiar with how to troubleshoot it. I’m sure they will unfortunately end up losing some business because of this and I’m not sure why they had to make the switch in the first place. Food is tasty enough I’ll probably eventually try and go back once they’ve figured it out.
pos	Best poke in Palo Alto. Pretty expensive but the portion sizes are huge - probably 2.5 meals for a medium bowl. Recommend House Salmon bowl.
neg	Bought a miso salmon bowl on Door Dash. It did not list crab as one of the ingredients, but it came with crab. Unfortunately, my fiancee is allergic to crab and had started eating the bowl before he noticed. Fortunately, his allergic response wasn't too bad, so we avoided a trip to the emergency room this time.
pos	We've been buying here for a couple of years, since the opening of the place. The service is great, the fish is fresh, all the rest of the food is fresh and tasty. Now, in corona era, they only do online orders and it's super fast.
neu	great salads. Will revise rating to 5* if Poke House PA stops including disposable utensils on pick-up orders, even when  "no utensils" is selected when ordering online
pos	Good poke bowl, large portions. A little on the expensive side.
neg	I wanted some hand rolls, so ordered their 3/$12.50 - in Spam Musubi, spicy tuna, and unagi - unfortunately, the rice was gummy, both the spam and unagi rolls had too much teriyaki sauce, which dripped and made the rolls too salty, and the rolls were rolled too loose.  The only ok tasting one was the spicy tuna, but again, it was rolled really loose.  I wanted to like it, but couldn’t finish it -
neg	Looks good on the outside but the service here is a mess. Constant miscommunication, it takes 2-3 repetitions to be understood. At the end they just took my payment, put the open plate with the salad in front of me and left, even though I mentioned twice that I want it to go. Had to wait until they come back and pack it for me.
pos	Best poke bowls in the South Bay. The food is great and the portions are huge. In my experience the service has always been good.
neg	Would not provide cup of water. Water bottle $4 Did not have a trash receptacle, was told to go to neighboring restaurant to throw trash away.
neu	They were out of spicy tuna at 6pm, and the pre-designed bowl options were limited. No good beverages to go with spicy food. I liked the place that was there before better
neg	They put extreme sauce to make the food tasty. Not right portion. Rice was too sticky. I guess nowadays assemble food are so popular.
pos	Poke bowl is good. They have a lot of toppings including octopus! Their california rolls are mediocre though.
neg	Great food, but staff ignores you for 20 min while preparing delivery orders in front of you.
pos	My favorite poké in the Bay area
pos	Amazing fresh Poke. High quality ingredients, quick service, generous portions and nice environment. Best Poke I've had!
pos	Good Poke with many options to customize your bowl. Replaced an inferior place (PoleLove) in January 2019.

pos	Generous helpings of protein,delicious toppings. Always offer a free scoop of crab! Can't go wrong here!

pos	Fresh meal that never disappoints. Love my regular bowls from Poke House!
pos	My favorite poke place in the Bay Area! Order online for easy pick up service!
neg	They don't accept orders in person.  You have to use their inconvenient website or grubhub
pos	Great poke. Many options. Upgrade to the seaweed salad (but be sure to get a toothpick).
pos	Easy healthy gluten free low carb high protien quick meal
pos	Great atmosphere, amazing service, and delicious poke! Will definitely come back!

pos	Ora Bura Turkey america 
pos	Pizza made with special sausage is very unique and delicious. The menu I ate was so delicious that I was curious about the taste of the other menus as well.  There is dedicated outdoor seating for the dining room.
neu	-bucatini carbonara ($18.50)  it's been so long since ive had a great carbonara dish at a restaurant - the one from howies was actually pretty good. the only downside for me (that doesn't really have a huge impact on the overall dish- more so what i wish was able to be change for improvement) was that it wasn't as creamy as id like and the ratio of the pasta along with the bacon was also a bit off. what made me a little disappointed was the service with the staff. originally someone had asked us to grab menus, sit down, then they'll stop by to take our orders. but we sat down for at least 10 minutes before someone (assumingly their manager/lead) asked "are we ignoring our customers now?" as the servers were just standing around. besides the hiccup with their service- overall this spot was super cute. there's indoor and outdoor seating -- and each spots' location has their own vibes. from what it seems it's definitely friends, family, and dates friendly - within the plaza theres also a lot of options for desserts, grocery running options, and some small businesses/boutiques!  8/10 would recommend yall to check this place/plaza out  thank you again to the staff that acknowledged my friend and i and went above and beyond to make sure we had what needed.
pos	Great service! Very efficient and pizza tastes fresh! The dough leaves a lot to be desired but, good enough! They take Apple Pay!
pos	Our choice for pizza in the Palo Alto and Menlo Park area.  Consistency of flavors is good if the cutting of slices is a bit irregular.  Flavor is also the best for the area and the pizzas are not heavy (crust is on the thinner side) so no feelings of lethargy afterward even if you go for one slice too many.
pos	Nice place to hangout if you are in the area. They have a decent wine and beers and some beers on tap. Not the cheapest wine, but good overall taste. We only tried the homeless appetizer and boy it was big! Can easily serve  three people for an appetizer. We sat at the bar area and were quickly served by the energetic Lauren ! Would come back here.
pos	We still haven't found a GREAT Pizza in this area. But Howie's is pretty good and it's a great place to sit outside and enjoy the day. The service is always wonderful.
neu	Salad was good but the pizza was soggy in the middle. The garlic bread had too much garlic and nothing else. Prices were much too high n everything
pos	Solid flavours, fresh ingredients. Price point of $25 for a pizza was a bit on the higher side for prosciutto & arugula. That being said, the crust had a good bit and everything was fresh. Actual flavours of the pizza was well balanced. Service was reasonable, nothing that stood out of the ordinary.
pos	Their was one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten for my whole life, each bite made me eat more.
pos	Go to place when visiting Stanford. Great beers on tap...wines...and pizza. The hummus appetizer is a meal in itself. We sit outside and take in the fresh California air. Enjoy!
pos	We had a lovely dinner here. Prompt and courteous, we ordered 2 half-&-half pizzas. Lots of veggie options. We had the pesto, the veggie, the margarita, and the potato one. They were all delicious. My favorite was the veggie with its lovely green olives. We also enjoyed the chees-y balls and garlic bread. The service very polite and efficient. Perfect for a table of hungry kids! Love to come back here!
pos	Best pizza I've had in the Palo alto/ mountain view area. It's a bit more pricy than other pizza but it really is much better and the ingredients are good and fresh.
pos	They have the best Caesar salad and hummus served with crispy pizza dough.
pos	They recently added 5 pasta dishes to there ever expanding menu of deliciousness!! I've only had the pleasure of eating the Bolognese, so far, but plan to go try a few more. This menu expansion is welcomed, as Howie cooks with high quality ingredients and love. Makes for a great meal, no matter what you choose.  Howie's has absolutely delicious pizza, great staff, and an interesting diverse beer selection for being such a small restaurant, they have some good wine too. I highly recommend stopping in!!  P.S. get the Spicy Meatballs appetizer!! You'll thank me later.
pos	I’m very recomend. Good beer, good pizza good location. Easy for parking. I like there.
pos	One of the best pizzeria.  Love the white bread done with the pizza dough. I always ask to make the crispy. I love the salads too, especially the one with the cubed salami. And the staff is always curt and ready.
neu	Yesterday was my first time ordering from here. I ordered sausage and onion pizza. I added extra cheese. The pizza looked delicious and the toppings were huge. The issue was some of the slices didn't have cheese on them just sauce. The slices that did have cheese on them, the cheese didn't stretch it just feel off the pizza. 😔
pos	Neat place to hang out with friends. A counter bar is available. Their margherita and baked potato pizza was a pleasure to bite on. You can order half and half as well
pos	best pizza ever i just tried it today and the crust was sooo good and the pepperoni and cheese was good in it took 10 minutes to make and the the drink is soo fizzy try it its so good 10/10  i love it
pos	Pizza was superb.  Crust was just right, thin but not too thin, crisp, not soggy.  Delicious toppings. My salad was well crafted with fresh and interesting ingredients. We shared one pizza and one large salad amongst three of us and had plenty of food.  On the monies side, the restaurant was very noisy.  It was hard to hold a conversation.  The draft beer list was not bad, but lacked variety.
pos	The shrimp + pesto pasta and pappardelle + mushroom pasta dishes are so good! Those cookies are to die for too!
pos	I recently had a shrimp with Pesto pizza at Howie's that was amazing. I am usually a traditional tomato sauce pizza lover, but this changed me. The shrimp was moist and tender which complemented perfectly the sweet basil. The crust is always great at Howie's....crisp and soft. The whole pizza was a blending of many flavors and textures that I hope to enjoy again very soon.
pos	Prompt service, tasty pizza, great crust. Can be soggy at times, but it comes out piping hot. The garlicky prawns are tasty, especially with left over pizza crust. The Chinese chicken salad is always wonderful. Nice family place overall.
pos	I've probably been here 30 times. Their pizza is delicious. Some of the best in town. The outside seating is great. I like their water bottles on each table. The chicken sandwich features melted cheese encasing the slices of bread, an interesting touch.
pos	My favorite pizza in the bay. The sourdough crust is what makes it amazingly unique. House made fennel sausage is unreal and they make the best garlicky buttermilk ranch I have ever tasted...I could drink it by itself. We always sit outside!  @treatyousef
pos	Casual pizza spot with quick service. The apps didn’t measure up to the pizza so I’d say to dive right into the pizza menu. We had the prosciutto and arugula - it was amazing. Definitely a great takeout option as well.
pos	Howie's is as good ever! The pizza has the best ingredients. My personal favorite is the potato pizza. During COVID-19 they have outdoor seating on their patio which has 2 to 6 person seating.
pos	Amazing place and service. They go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. Made a tiny mistake and they gave us a whole extra pizza and garlic bread which basically halved the cost. High quality tasty pizza. Servers are amazing
pos	Huge portions I guess but very greasy
neu	Went on a Saturday afternoon.  Service: Took us a long time to get a table outside even though there were couple tables vacant. Somehow they didn't have a good system going to seat guests.  Food: Very good - the pizza tasted very fresh. Also had the Chinese Chicken Salad and that was yummy.
pos	Great pizza, so good when it was still hot. During covid you can still find a spot to set and eat. Pricey 💰 but worth the money and next day heated in oven, it was still great 😂
neu	Professional, polite and very quick to prepare you a slice. A slice of thin floppy bread and grease.
pos	Great pizza and great service. The waitress was genuinely friendly as was everyone else.
neg	Some time back my family and I went to Howie's since it is nearby. This turned out to be a terrible mistake.  They didn't serve us for a long time. We were OK with that, and got a snack while we waited. We then bought food and drinks for the whole family. At the end of the meal, we're told that we need to pay extra because we ate snacks while waiting for them to NOT serve us.  They love their customers so much they'll tell you that it is just fine if you never come back.  Not a problem, I'm happy to never return.
pos	Howie's is one of my favorite pizza places in the area. Their potato rosemary pizza is divine, as is the margherita. They have pitchers of beer and salad/appetizers, too. The wait can be really long on weekend evenings. Restaurant is clean and homey, and the servers are efficient and friendly.
pos	Pizza is better than most of the Bay Area... They do that NY crispy style and they have a great set of lunch specials with salads, drinks, and a slice.  Really unexpected find in a shopping center in Palo Alto.  Love this place
pos	Some.of the best pizza I've had in 20 years in California. It almost made me feel like I was back in New York. The slices are huge and there's a Bice selection of beers on tap.
neg	Wow. I am still shaking by the incredibly horrible experience I just had with the female manager of this restaurant (she has a British accent, or something similar). I placed a large order over the phone, and apparently was given incorrect pricing. I was told that the plain pizza price included 3 toppings, and each additional topping was $2. I said, "really?" and he said, quite clearly, "yes." so i ordered three toppings, and said again, "so those three are included in the price?" and he said, "yes they are." I said, "wow, that's great!"  Fast forward to me, driving home after picking them up. I started going over the total in my head and realized, that place is expensive but there's no way it could have cost that much. So, I phone Howie's, explained what had happened to the guy who answered, and he found my order and understood the mistake. He just said, that's not actually how much the pizza costs, and I said that I was told that. He tried to just get me to drop it, but then offered to put the manager on. She must have told him to get rid of me, because he came back on the line after a minute and just repeated that the price info was incorrect. I said, "wait, I thought you were getting the manager?"  Then the awful manager came on. I asked her if he had told her the situation, and she said yes, that was not the correct pricing. I repeated the entire conversation that I had had when ordering. She actually told me "I trained all of my staff and there's no way any one of them could have told you this." I was speechless for a moment, maybe sputtered "What?", at which point she said "I don't believe you are telling the truth, there's no way one of my staff would have said that." At that point, I got upset, asking her what happened to customer service, and why would I make something like that up. (it was a matter of around $6). I wish I had never called--ignorance is bliss--since at this point she told me I wasn't welcome in their restaurant.  Do not give this place your money! Seriously, I would have been happy with an admission of a mistake. What harm would that have done them? Crazy people out there.
pos	i would have never thought i would pay more for less pizza, but this was well worth it. the crust is lovely and the artisan toppings are very creative and delicious. it's not the best decor, but that's okay i would rather sit outside on a nice day, any day.
pos	The Howie's Artisan Pizza provides satisfaction to the customer/consumer by literally dropping and atomic bomb of flavor in your mouth, Howie's Artisan Pizza is deliciously hand crafted by very experienced chefs, who have dedicate their whole lives to creating the perfect pizza. The airy, yet crunchy crust is even more breathtaking with every single bite, and as for the rest, I think I'm going to let you decide for yourself! so don't be a rabid porcupine and go enjoy Howie's Artisan Pizza today! also, I most certainly do not work for them.
pos	BOMB! arugula and prosciutto pizza, yes!
pos	I love this place my favorite dish here would be a chicken chipotle sandwich which they took off the and put it back on I raised hell when they took it off hydro 2 and 1/2 hours to come and have a chicken chipotle sandwich if you don't like crunchy food that's not a sandwich for you the pizza is awesome they have a $7 slice of pizza with a drink I believe it stops at 4 or 5 p.m. so come on over and try their Pizza the baked potato pizza
pos	Just back from lunch there.  3 slices for the family and some garlic bread.  Really tasty, and good service.  The garlic bread was particularly excellent, and I'm looking forward to going back and trying the baked potato pizza at some point.
pos	So good. Give my all the cookies and pizza. The pizza is great but oh my goodness the cookies are out of this world. Yaahooo.. I just moved here and this is my favorite place!
pos	The pizzas and hot wings are a family favorite. We love the fresh ingredients and friendly attentive staff. Definitely recommend!
pos	The best pizza crust in the area. Just the right texture and crunchiness, enhances the excellent cheese and ingredients they use. The salads are also pretty good.
pos	I love this place so much every friday i would go here during school  and they would serve a huge slice of pizza and a soda for $7.50 i know its a lot but its worth the price if you ever want to go to a good pizza place this is the place to go
pos	Prosciutto Pie is the best I've had.  Fresh arugula, thinly sliced prosciutto, fluffy shredded parmesan, thin layer of a cream sauce with a twist of lemon, artisan crust.  I eat the large by myself.  Must try!
neu	I have to admit that the pizza is good. We used to come in very frequently when they opened and also order take out but the recent hike in pricing is discouraging - be prepared to pay $20 for simple Margherita pizza if you go there. We switched to another place.
neg	The pizza was not good. The person that took my order never gave me the two medium sodas I ordered so I had to return to the restaurant and the same person made me wait an unreasonable amount of time over 10 min. I had to ask someone else to help.
neg	Pretty good pizza, but terrible service. Took over a half hour to get our food. I'd blame it on the lunch rush, but plenty of other tables got prompt service. Don't come here with hungry kids.
pos	It was busy and there was a 10 minute wait but it was worth it. Wound up sitting at the bar and still got amazing service. Friendly staff. Great Pizza. Reasonable price.
neu	The staff are very friendly but the pizza is very soggy. The pizza sauce is good but if you try and pick it up with one hand, half of the toppings will slide off.
pos	We had pizza (half pepperoni, half sausage/roasted onion) and the chinese chicken salad, they were both delicious.  The service was a little slow sitting outside, but overall a nice experience.
pos	Great Chinese Chicken Salad! The bomb actually. Decor is auight..got a more techie look that I like. Service is ok. I usually order to go. The guys handling the to go folks are usually pretty short with us and not the best service.
pos	Friendly staff, pizza has a great thin crust with just the right amount of chew, fresh and flavorful sauce, and premium toppings.
pos	Inventive a good pizzas. Priced well. Order an salad and a pizza to split for two people. Good value. House wine is okay also.
pos	Howie's is a local gem. He was early in the thin, neopolitan crust, and has a more California take on that style. The location is all California wines and beers, and all tasty. Go.
pos	Great food and service. Meatball sandwich was great.
pos	Hubby and I ate here a few months ago, we got a half Pizza Bianco, half Prosciutto & Arugula pizza.  The hint of lemon on the Prosciutto & Arugula made the pizza pop with flavor.. and made the Bianco even yummier than it already is.  I still love the Bianco as is.  I tried making it at home, but my version just doesn't compare to the original. Hubby had a Blue Moon and I had a Sparky's Root Beer.  His Blue Moon didn't disappoint, on point as usual, and my Sparky's had a nice bite to it.  Btw, their water glasses are "Made in Taiwan", so I approve!  :)  Will be back again, I wish they would open an establishment closer to Daly City or deliver to Daly City... that would be amaze-balls, but I'd be an ultimate fatty.  Gotta head over here again soon, I'm craving a Bianco

pos	Delicious pizza in a small but nice place, with very friendly service. 
pos	Delicious but squeezed for Koreans 
pos	We came on a saturday afternoon to get some ice cream, it was our first visit. The shop had customers but was not full. The selection of ice creams is sufficient but not enormous; the tastes are rather sophisticated, no simple options :)). We picked coconut in a bowl and strawberry in a waffle. Bowls are degradable and recycled which we appreciated. We paid around 14 usd (~5+ per ice cream, 1.50 for the waffle). Right outside the place the are benches and chairs - a perfect place to enjoy the ice cream. The ice creams were very tasty, not too sweet; the portion of one ball was sufficient. The place can definitely be recommended.
pos	They have the creamiest ice creams, i love salt & straw and thought nothing could beat that, but this one definitely surpassed my expectations. We had coffee with cocoa nib toffee and chocolate ice-cream, 2 scoops were enough between two people as the size is pretty big. We also tried their fruit flavours which were good too.
pos	I was a bit disappointed they didn’t do sample testing 🙁 Anyway, I gave the Jasmine Tea a try AND I don’t regret it one bit!! 🥰🥰  I also loved that I got a recyclable cup and spoon with my coned ice cream. Definitely came in handy when my ice cream started to leak through the bottom of my cone 😅
pos	The ice cream is so delicious and the service very friendly. Although it’s hard to choose because all the flavors are good, my go-to is a scoop of Rich Chocolate with Hot Fudge to make it a truly decadent.
pos	Exceptionally amazing ice cream and staff. First time visit and I ordered the Salted Butterscotch with Berry Compote + Crunch Cone. The crunch cone was ok, but the berry compote balanced the salt in the butterscotch. Amazing flavors and options to choose from.
neg	I used to like their ice cream but not so much now. It’s been a couple of years so maybe they changed hands and recipes. The ice cream is sickly sweet and not such a nice texture. It’s also pricier than other ice cream. Would not come back.
pos	Coconut with pandan might be the best ice cream I've ever had. Very toasty coconut flavor with a hard-to-describe twist that must be the pandan.  Amazing flavors, super creamy, pretty sweet - I guess average sweetness, for ice cream. Salt & Straw definitely has the strangest flavors, but Tin Pot has plenty of creative flavors (blue jasmine, raspberry rose tart, coconut pandan) and tastes the best to me.
neg	The ice cream is very sweet. We got a 14oz pint coffee with toffee bits for over $13. It's not creamy but with "sand bits" after stored for long time. Very disappointing.
pos	Loved this place!  We were hanging out with our vegan friend who was in the mood for ice cream hence we stopped here.  They had good varieties of regular flavors as well as 2 vegan options - chocolate coconut ice cream as well as baked apple sorbet. Both were really good and our friend was delighted!  I tried the butter pecan but it was tad too rich for me and also tried the toasted almond before settling on the rich chocolate single scoop and it was really good.  Fresh, local and organic - what not to love? Also, loved they didn't use plastic spoons when customers try flavors before deciding. Their cups are also bio degradable so was happy about the green environmental touch :)  Highly recommend!
neg	I got the brownie batter ice cream and it was more like a sorbet. I would say it was “crystalized” maybe due to a freezer burn.
pos	Great ice cream and fast service, the cashier felt like the bottle neck for the out the door line here.  Flavors can change with time, they sell ice cream or the favorite ones in larger take home containers also.  Choice of cup in different sizes or waffle cones.  They give small metal spoons for tasting, don't forget to drop them in the used jar for reuse.  The cups are also made out of "cardboard" without wax on the inside so recycling is easy.  Parking is a challenge for me this shopping area especially on weekends.  Few spots to sit outside.
pos	Tin Pot is a cute little ice cream shop that serves up some traditional flavors and some experimental flavors. Coming here with a group is always fun because pretty much anyone can find something that satisfies their ice cream craving here.  The Blue Jasmine Tea, Malted Milkshake, and Snickerdoodle Cookie are my favorite here.  The Blue Jasmine is, as you’d expect, floral. It doesn’t have any mixins, so it does feel a bit basic compared to the others.  The Malted Milkshake has little malt ball bits that are really satisfying to eat. I have no idea what I’m talking about but it tastes kind of vintage. Like from an ice cream shop from the fifties, in the best way possible.  The Snickerdoodle Cookie is my underdog. It’s very cinnamon-y, but also has the texture of a mint-chocolate chip since it has little snickerdoodle bits in it.
neu	Checked out this place because the line for Boba Guys next door was too long.  I sampled their Fudge Banana Foster ice cream and it was pretty good. One of their original flavor and it did not disappoint.  We ended up getting two scoops for $5.75. Cookie monster was a vanilla ice cream with cookies. Nothing really special about it. The Lavender Lemon Poppy seed ice cream was O.K. yep, just okay. They also have a special Butter Beer Float( $8) , it tasted weird that even my kid who loves sugar and ice cream didn't like it. I guess it was the caramel. For spending $15 I thought I would have more for what I spent. But it's okay. At least now I know.  The service was on point.
pos	phenomenal ice cream and super friendly service. my go to is cookie monster with whipped cream on top. Will miss this place when I move from PA!
pos	This small corner store in an outdoor shopping mall has some delicious ice cream. "Small batch" usually means expensive (and it was) but definitely worth the splurge. Tried strawberry and their malted milk chocolate. The malted was by far my favorite; I agree with other reviews that this particular flavor melts faster. Also tasted one of their ice cream sandwiches, cookies were ok but nothing amazing. No seating inside but tables outside.
pos	Tin pot offers very distinct flavors of gelato. I do prefer gelato because it is creamier than ice cream, but beware: sweeter and higher calories too!  The earl grey is the to go flavor here: very light, not sweet, creamy and pairs well with any other flavors. Toffee, chocolate, birthday cake flavors are all too sweet for my liking but if you have a sweet tooth go for it.  Cons: pricier than most other creameries, but its to be expected given location and how specialized it is. To save cost, go for a full tub instead of just a few scoops.
pos	Well priced, good selection. They can make the ice cream look like a face if you ask! Staff are friendly. A few chairs to sit and enjoy your ice cream.
pos	This place got me hooked on affogatos. I searched for other places but this is still my number one. Aside from the good coffee and amazing selection of ice cream, they also put in other things like whip cream and candy orange peel.
pos	Our favorite spot for a weekend treat! We've tried almost all of their flavors. My wife loves their Mint chocolate and Rich TCHO chocolate flavors whereas I'm a huge fan of their Malted cookie flavor. Salted butterscotch is a close second. We're definitely coming back very soon (maybe tonight!) to try out the Blue Jasmine flavor. Another good thing is that you accumulate points whenever you make a purchase which you can redeem later for toppings. Win win!
pos	So yummy!! Came here with friends and family and everyone enjoyed it. Reasonably priced and really cute presentation. Quick line, although it was rather long!
pos	Super friendly, inventive flavors, and masterful flavor delivery. Ice cream aficionado heaven.
pos	If you have not had their salted butterscotch ice cream you’re seriously missing out on some terrific ice cream. Must try. So delicious!
pos	The TCHO chocolate flavor here is incredible. It comes densely packed with irregularly shaped pieces of dark chocolate in addition to the already rich chocolate base.
pos	Their sundaes are really good. Chocolate and vanilla tastes great. I was only visiting for the weekend. I wish they had their ice cream out in Denver, Colorado. It'd be a hit.
pos	One of the best (if not the best) ice cream place in the bay area. The flavors I always have a tough time in choosing between are rich dark chocolate (with tcho), salted butterscotch, malted milk with chocolate and coffee. They have seasonal sorbets and other bold and experimental flavors too but I just can't get enough of their classics! Always leaves a super clean and awesome taste.
pos	This creamery is definitely worth the trip if you are in the area. The flavors are absolutely delicious and the ice cream has an amazing silky smooth texture. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming and are quick to let you try flavors and give recommendations as to what to mix and match and which toppings suit which flavors. Also, don’t shy away from the sweet corn cookie! If I am ever around Palo Alto again, I will be sure to return to Tin Pot.
neg	Got a piece of plastic in one of our 3 orders.  Ice cream was good.  Fortunately it was a big piece and my daughter said that she doesn't want to eat the chocolate piece.  Very disappointed and concerned about what we just ate, smaller pieces of plastic.
pos	I just love this place! Our friend, who is vegan, was hanging out with us the other day and he was in the mood for ice cream, so we took him there. They have varieties of regular flavors, non-vegan versions with milk, which is more of my choice of ice cream, and they had two amazing vegan options: chocolate coconut ice cream and baked apple sorbet. Our friend was off his chair when he tried it and we were also thrilled with their other choices. I decided to go for butter pecan, but it was too strong for me - luckily they let you try the ice cream before ordering, so in the end I ordered rich chocolate scoop. This place has fresh and organic ingredients for all ice creams  - what not to like about it?
pos	Unlike any ice cream I’ve ever had with novel flavors. Blue jasmine one was awesome! Toppings are elegant and all natural. My daughter loved the eyes they put on the ice cream.
neu	Growing up, I had a friend whose family owned an ice cream company. The quick rule to assess an ice creams quality is how cold it makes your teeth and mouth feel. The colder it is, the higher the water content is versus cream where the more cream, the better the ice cream. Tin Pot has decent flavors to pick from but the ice cream was not the best quality I’ve had...
pos	The ice cream here is delicious, much better than the national chains. We liked that they had all of the allergy information readily available. There are vegan options, egg-free options, and even dairy-free options.  The mint chocolate chip was one of the mintiest ice creams we've ever had. And the vegan chocolate ice cream was delicious, especially considering that it had no eggs or milk. It did have coconut flakes which was an unexpected delight.
pos	Why I absolutely love love love Tin Pot Creamery:  It has all the elements of a phenomenal ice cream.  First-the creamy factor, then just the right amount of sweetness (but of course this depends on the flavor you get.  In my opinion, the malted one is on the sweeter side.)  Then the melt factor.  This ice cream seems to melt a little faster compared to others I've had so eat it fast.  Did I mention they also sell my favorite "Corn Cookie"?  I come here every chance I can get.  Conveniently located near my work may be a factor.  My favorite go-to flavors:  earl grey, four barrel coffee, snickerdoodle, lemon poppy (seasonal), pumpkin (seasonal) blueberry (seasonal)
pos	Excellent gourmet ice cream. Ingredients seem mostly natural. Some dairy free + vegan options. Friendly staff. Fairly pricey.
neu	Impossibly good flavors but during my most recent visit, the ice-cream all felt a bit "grainy" or "sandy". Not sure if they had a bad batch or something went wrong in the factory but all 4 flavors we bought were so. At their price point, this is simply not acceptable. I left it at 3-stars due to my previous great experiences.
pos	Creative flavours and kind staff who will let you sample as many flavours as you wish. Alas the price for a scoop is really high and the ice cream somewhat hard, you kind of have to wait for it to thaw a bit. They're passionfruit with cookies was terrific you just wish they made more sorbet flavours it's California there are tons of wonderful fresh fruit out here
pos	Delicious ice cream! Loved the sweet cream with honey balsamic swirl and the roasted banana fudge ripple. They let us sample the flavors and were generally nice. I’d come back if I’m ever in the area again
pos	Tinpot has some of the best handmade ice cream around! They have a wide array of classic flavors, plus some more unique flavors. The classic flavors though all have unique touch to them. I personally love coffee and Earl Grey. Those two flavors are an amazing combo and are both very delicious on their own! The kids cones are cute as they come with little eyes. You can get pints to go if you're in a hurry or want to take something home. I also have cookies and ice cream sandwiches. I've never had anything here that wasn't anything less than amazingly delicious! You can't go wrong with this place. There's typically always a line, but it moves pretty quick. If you're planning on going more than once be sure to use the rewards program.
pos	Worth the wait, awesome ice cream. Already want to go back for more
pos	My favorite creamery in the Peninsula and South Bay! The ice cream is consistency creamy, and the flavors are amazing! Try the Earl Grey, Four Barrel Coffee, and Salted Butterscotch. Also don't miss their seasonal flavors - they had a lavender lemon poppyseed in the summer that I still dream about.  They also make cookies that rival their ice cream! The Black Magic shortbread cookies are addicting, and the Chocolate Chunk is one of my favorite chocolate chip cookies ever. You can get an ice cream sandwich and have it all!
pos	The consistency and quality of the ice cream here is far and away better than just about any other Ice Creamery. The Cinnamon Snickerdoodle is one of my new favorites, whereas their Four Barrel Coffee should only be consumed earlier in the day—tasty and potent. My all-time favorite is the Mint Chocolate Chip ... It's like chewing on mint leaves it is so fresh.
pos	Great ice creams and friendly staff. It's in a great location too
pos	My favorite ice cream joint ever since sweet retreat burnt down. Taste great and a nice but small selection of flavors. The pints are super expensive, and toppings cost a dollar each. ($11-$14)
pos	Great ice cream, very unique flavours! Peanut butter with brownie was by far my favourite but also loved 4 barrel coffee. Chocolate and vanilla were good but pretty standard. Definitely worth trying:)
pos	Fantastic flavors in a great creamy base with great cones.  The best ice cream we've found so far in the south bay.  A bit pricey on the ice cream scale, but not unexpectedly so.  Go midweek to avoid the (modest) line that forms on weekend evenings, but the lines aren't too bad even at peak times.
pos	The Best!  The ice cream here is so creamy and they have a great assortment of ice creams (my faves are the butterscotch, the toasted almond, and the coffee, though nothing is bad here). They have a few other things you can get like cookies and coffee, but the ice cream is why you go here.  They have a lot of ice creams in pint form too so you can just grab and go (and if you forgot to bring a cooler they can sell you a freezer bag as well). Just make sure you don't have more than 20-30minutes home. :)  Go here all the time, definitely our #1 pick for ice cream around. Not so great if you want a variety of toppings though, they like to keep it pretty simple.
pos	The ice cream is so good. I had a chocolate one with TCHO chocolate shards and it was amazing. I haven't had a chocolate ice cream that good in a long time and it tasted a lot of them. The kids get 2 sugary eyeballs placed on the scoop with a smile and it is really cute. Highly recommend.
pos	Nice little ice cream place with a variety of creative flavors (no fruit sorbets, but there was one or two fruit-based (e.g. passionfruit) ice cream flavors). I like that they have more creative/high-quality toppings than most ice cream places, and I like that for each ice cream flavor they give a topping recommendation.  I had the passionfruit and blue jasmine tea flavors, with candied orange peel as the topping. The sweetness level was just right, I’d go back again :-)
pos	Hands down my favorite ice cream shop. And that's coming from a self-proclaimed ice cream connoisseur. I am obsessed with this spot- Tin Pot serves up delicious and ever-changing flavors including Rich Chocolate with TCHO Shards, Lavender with Blueberry Swirl, Four Barrel Coffee with Cocoa Nib Toffee, and Earl Grey Tea. For those of you who don't handle dairy well, they offer 2-3 vegan choices as well. Employees are always friendly and smiley, but then again, who wouldn't be happy serving up the best ice cream in the Bay Area...or dare I say best ice cream...EVER!
pos	The ice cream here is high quality and tastes fresh. However portion size is small and price is expensive, about 5.75 for a regular size, or 2 scoops. Would definitely come back but only for special occasions.
pos	Tinpot is my favorite place to go for ice cream.  There is always a large varieties of flavors to choose from.  The ice cream tastes are always consistently smooth and the right amount of creaminess.  Eating this often is probably not good for you but I always stop by whenever I am in the area.  They also have pints ready for take home!
pos	This creamery is located in the middle of the large Town&Country plaza, and they have a cute storefront and friendly staff that are happy to let you sample different flavors!  They have a lot of neat and unique flavors, so it's hard to choose what to sample, but my favorites are Four Barrel Coffee and Mootella! I only wish they had more sorbet flavors, since I love sorbet and their blackberry lime is too sour for my taste. The ice cream is a bit pricy, but it's a better deal if you buy 2 scoops instead of one!
pos	Great ice cream in a great location at Town & Country. A little pricey, but well worth treating yourself once in awhile.
pos	Best ice cream in the Bay Area! I love the maple crumb donut flavor. Second to it the chocolate TCHO flavor.
pos	As someone who doesn't eat dairy, a creamery isn't usually a prime destination. Though in going to the Palo Creamery with some friends (who love ice cream), I was very pleasantly surprised by the vegan passion fruit sorbet. It was a blast of flavor that made me a lover of "ice cream" again.
pos	Beyond excellent customer service, super friendly! We just grabbed pints to go and they were delicious!
neu	Got a pint of the Earl Grey gelato. I wish it was more assertive of a flavor because it was pretty mild. Almost like a vanilla. Also, the texture was light and fluffy and I think I prefer a thicker texture. To top it off it was also $11.50 for a pint - which is crazy. I still prefer bi rite for texture and taste. If you want light and fluffy than this is your place.
neu	It is a very unique place to get ice cream. The location is convenient, the flavors are different and delicious. Im not a huge fan of dark/mint chocolate which is at the very end of a sugar cone, they do have other cones that do not include that. They have all sorts of toppings available and some options as far as baked goodies.  As far as cleanliness, this place is a great place if you want to grab ice cream from a location that doesnt have the stench of dried up old milk, Baskin Robin's does off of Middlefield which is why we dont go to that particular Baskin Robin.  We have had Tin Pot once and have not gone back since only because it comes down to preferences for us personally. We dont dislike Tin Pot but it isnt our first top 5 places to go to when we want ice cream.
pos	One of my favorite ice cream shops. They have a solid coffee toffee ice cream made with Four Barrel Coffee and a cookies and cream (Cookie Monster) flavors that I always order. Don't order the waffle cones, they crumble too easily.
pos	Wow! Excellent small batch I've cream. Very friendly staff. I had the cookie dough ice cream in a waffle cone... There is tasty surprise (at least it was for me) in the bottom of the waffle cone that you just have to experience for yourself.
neu	Pros: - creamy, decadent ice cream (I prefer my ice cream more creamy than icy) - sweet cream with honey balsamic swirl - creative flavors!  Cons: - line moved sooooo slowly - not too inexpensive, but I think the quality was worth it - no seating - forgettable (tasty, but simply not memorable)  Bottom line: this is a nice place to stop for a treat if you happen to be in the shopping center. I would not go out of my way to have this ice cream again though.
neu	OK ice cream.  Got the mint chocolate chip and did like that it wasn't super sweet, but the mint flavor was a bit overpowering. Seems a bit overpriced for what you get - barely a full scope, almost like they are trying to not to round it off.  Also, they seem to often be out of cones, which is unfortunate as their cones are actually decent.
neg	How I hate to write this review, but I can't begin to describe my disappointment that Tin Pot dropped Brown Butter Pecan from their menu. This is my favorite ice cream! Since Tin Pot first opened, I have willingly driven from Mountain View to Palo Alto on a fairly regular basis because they were one of the few places that offered that flavor. Last Sunday I went there to help them celebrate the beginning of their first birthday only to discover my favorite was not available. I was told it had been dropped temporarily - "it will come back again" a very pleasant employee told me although she had no idea when that would be. So, I left. Empty handed. No ice cream for this loyal patron. How sad! Please, pretty please, I beg you to bring Brown Butter Pecan back so i can yet again frequent my used-to-be-favorite ice cream establishment.
neg	The ice cream is quite good, but I can't get past the sticker shock. For example, a pint to go is $11 minimum, and $14 for 'premium' flavors! It does not taste that much better than Safeway ice cream, imho :)
pos	One of the best ice cream shops in South Bay! They have quite a few flavors  (they use Four Barrel coffee!) to choose from and there's usually a line (a good sign).
neg	Overpriced, ice cream was not that good and serving size was stingy
pos	When approaching this place you'll see a line leading out the door. The reason for it is the delicious ice cream they have. Luckily the line moves fairly quickly because the anticipation of that delicious cone will test your patience. The staff is extremely helpful and courteous, it's definitely worth the drive down there.
pos	Delicious, rich flavors that can't be found anywhere else. As a foodie, ice cream is very high on my list of important foods and this place nails making it. The texture is very soft and creamy while not being too heavy.
pos	Food quality rating: 5 stars. So many flavors and by now I've probably tried all of them! Everything is so good and the "seasonal flavors" thing is cool. I like the little extras you can add to your order too. Customer Service/staff: 5 stars. Never met a mean or hot tempered staff here. All super easy spirited, patient and kind. Especially that funny old guy. Setting: 5 stars. Nothing wrong with that at all! Lots of highschoolers (but who can really blame them!) around if you come during school hours (I'm guessing 8 to 3) but their not a problem - (they sprout up all over town and country to be honest). The little signs on the door are cute and I like how there are two doors, exit and entrance, it makes it seem like they actually care about order and customer satisfaction. Over-all rating: 5 stars! Duh! :D
pos	A cute shop with artisan specialty ice creams.  It's a bit pricey but the ice cream is divine.  They allow three samples per person and I love that they are eco-friendly and use metal spoons for the samples.  I highly recommend the Four Barrel Coffee ice cream.  Use the paypal deal to pay and get $3 off your purchase.  There is plenty of parking in the Town & Country Plaza.
pos	Earl grey and roasted banana with fudge were both awesome. I'll definitely be back to try more flavors. Scoops are small so get two!  Tip: If you’re just buying pints you can skip the line and go straight to the register.
pos	Second time coming to this chain, first time coming to this location. Fun and tasty flavors with a texture that is fluffy with some bite. Had a really enjoyable experience with friends. Service is excellent too. Only thing is that the prices are a little high, but it's about what you would expect for a specialty place like this.
pos	Pretty good. Got lavender poppy seeds and earl grey. Yummy. Ok price too.
pos	This place is magical!  I was craving ice cream and finally made the trip here after having this place bookmarked since it first opened. There was a line when I got there but it was nowhere near the size of CREAM so that made me happy :) I waited in line contemplating what to get because they have soooo many unique flavors to choose from! After sampling a bit ( 3 samples per person ) i decided to go with two scoops in a cup (because I'm not that into waffle cones). I chose to get the four barrels coffee with cacao nib toffee and the salted butterscotch, and I sampled the creme fraische, cookie monster, and sweet cream with honey balsamic swirl. I had the HARDEST time choosing... omg because they were all sooo good!  Four barrels coffee with cacao nib toffee: I think saying the entire name of this flavor took longer than me finishing my ice cream because this was amazing! The coffee flavor was intense, rich, and smooth. The cacao nib toffee was a nice crunch.  Salted butterscotch: dare I say this was better than.. sea salt caramel because it was! Butterscotch has a more rich and rewarding flavor when paired with salt. It was smooth, decadent, and intoxicating.. i kind of wish I went home with a pint of this :(  The sweet cream with honey balsamic swirl was interesting and it left me wanting more but I couldn't pick it over the two I did order. The cookie monster is a crowd favorite and I could see why because it's a nice variation of the cookies and cream ice cream. The creme fraische was light and smooth. Overall I really enjoyed their ice cream and their prices were reasonable so I'll be back!
neu	Long line out the door must be a good sign. Probably picked the wrong flavor because my tropical sorbet wasn’t too special. Apparently the mango with sticky rice was great.
pos	Extremely friendly and good service. Hard to find these days. Recommend
neg	This place is still requiring a mask for vaccinated individuals.  I wanted to purchase ice cream and had my vaccination card with me.  The worker was super rude and didn’t want to help me without a mask.  Per CA law, masks are not required as of 6/15.  Get with it Tin Pot !
pos	The caramelized banana and earl grey is super tasty!! And they make them super cute!
pos	Excellent quality ice cream. Delicious flavors and the toppings are awesome (you must try the brownie pieces and hot fudge sauce!). Quite pricey but great for a treat.
pos	Wonderfully unique flavors and helpful staff.
pos	The staff at "Tin Pot Creamery" where very kind!😁 I do recommend going there. The ice cream was extremely sweet and delicious. I do recommend going there because you will love it! Thank you Tin Pot Creamery for making today a great experience! 🤣😍🤗
pos	I dont have the photos from last time I was there but, I can say that the ice cream is very good, delicious!!! The stuff there were super nice and let you taste from all of the special kind of tastes they have (that was before the Covid-19) Go check them out if you are around
neg	The high rating of this place is surprising.  The ice cream is average, while the portions are tiny and the prices are high.  Picking up a pint of ice cream at CVS is likely a better option.
pos	WOW!!!! I LOVE the ice cream here! So much that I have been back here 3 times in just the past 10 days and brought 8 friends with me on my ice cream binge!! Yep, Tin Pot is officially my new favorite ice cream joint and it is a dangerously close commute for me. Weekly ice cream runs is now officially an event amongst my friends. Le sigh. Time to triple up on gym training :P  I will state upfront that gelato addicts, this is not for you. Even though Tin Pot is super creamy and on the soft side, it cannot be substitute for gelato and I would not compare the two as they are entirely separate categories. Also, if you love sugary ice cream that is super sweet, you might not be as in love with Tin Pot as I am.  My favorite flavors that I keep coming back for are the four barrel coffee with cocoa nib toffee and the earl grey tea. This winning combo is fantastics together and it's the one I keep coming back for time after time. I also really liked the options with honey lavender or creme fraiche but those flavors are harder to pair with so I stick with the above flavors.  Single Scoop: $3.50 Double: $4.50 Triple: $5.50  Add $.50 for a cone and $.75 for each topping.
neg	Ice cream is pretty good. But the man who served us named Steve was very rude and hostile to me a young Hispanic woman. But was pretty nice to the white woman behind me. And this is a pretty common thing with Steve. He's usually rude to me while nicer to his white patrons. Guess this is a place I can no longer support because of this
pos	I really like Tin Pot's ice cream. The favors are updated seasonally and they have a wide range of unique one's that you can't get in other places. The only downside is that it's quite expensive.
pos	Loved the ice cream here. Most flavors are different than you get in regular ice cream shops. They tastes really good. Overall shop is clean and staff is helpful.
pos	Perfect for once cream on a 80 degree day. long lines though.
pos	Great, expensive ice cream. Many flavors change, but they always seem to have the best flavor which is the chocolate malt. Save yourself the trouble and the money and just get a pint of that!
pos	The toppings made this ice cream event for me. Gorgeous toasted coconut and amazing brownie pieces would perfectly top off any of their flavors. We found this in Sunset Magazine - and it did not disappoint!
pos	Homemade ice creams, cones, cookies, brownies, marshmallows, and pies. Put that all together and you have Tin Pot Creamery.  Tin Pot Creamery offers a wide variety of ice cream flavors ranging from a sophisticated dark chocolate with chocolate shards, to relatively simple flavors like butterscotch, banana, and pumpkin pie. Get the cone or sundaes and not the cup for an extra treat.
pos	Tin Pot is amazing! Some of the best ice cream we have ever had! We drive all the way from Redwood City each week for our fix! Highly recommended for anyone in the area!
pos	Cute, small local spot for artisanal ice cream. Creative, well balanced flavors. Cute scoops for kids with sugar "googley eyes". No indoor seating.
pos	One of my favorites in Palo Alto. The flavors are unique (big fan of the four barrel coffee) and the ice cream is always rich and creamy with a nice texture.
pos	Absolutely amazing ice-cream! The best I've had in the peninsula. Expect lines. Try their butterscotch, lavendar/blueberry, rich chocolate....or petty much any flavor!
pos	Excellent ice cream in this quaint little place. I like the atmosphere and people are friendly. I recommend any and all flavors! Good toppings too :)
pos	Really nice ice cream. Several flavors available. Nice staff and very patient with kids. Sometimes you can experience a bit of a long queue outside
pos	Fine if you’re going and getting some ice cream scooped there to eat right away but don’t get a pint to go! Twice now I’ve tried and it’s been VERY freezer burned both times. So disappointing.
pos	My favorite ice cream spot in the Palo Alto area! The waffle cones fall apart sometimes, but the ice cream itself is top notch. Try the Earl Grey!
pos	They are open during Shelter in place and only one person ahead of me when I was there. This is my first time trying Tin Pot and I had the Blue Jasmine Tea & Passion Fruit Poppyseed Flavors and they are both good (see photo)!
pos	This place can get busy but their ice cream flavors (some of them) are unique and very tasty. Anything you get in their cone is very good and worth every penny.
pos	I ordered a bunch of individual servings from Tin Pot in Palo Alto for an ice cream social after another vendor cancelled on me. They came through for me, despite the short notice. Tht ice cream social was a success!
pos	Great choices of ice cream, with recommended toppings. The one thing is the scoops are tiny. But would definitely come here again as a treat to myself.
neg	$9 milk shake. No hot fudge, no toppings, milk was frozen so he tried to pour what he could out of the frozen gallon, so not the best experience
pos	Tin Pot is the place to be.  It has amazing flavors and you almost never wait in line for more than 5 minutes.  They also sell cookies and ice cream cakes!
pos	really good smooth ice cream. the portions are big IMHO.  Just make sure that the ice cream is cold. Some times they serve it and it still hasnt set.
pos	Best ice cream in Palo Alto
pos	Hands down the best ice cream of my life. The cookies are salted so perfectly to bring out the chocolate and they are insanely good.
pos	That's good ice cream! The have original flavours like lavender for example. The ice cream is delicious! If you pick a small cup, it will actually be small, for once.
pos	Great ice cream with some really unique flavors. Almost always a line and it isn't cheap but worth the time and money if you are willing.
pos	Whoa! That is yummy. Best ice cream around and slightly cheaper than some other, less tasty competitors.  I recommend the malted milk with chocolate flakes.
pos	Tasty little ice cream place. Kind of expensive, but all homemade ice cream is these days. Absolutely delicious and a nice little one of a kind place!
pos	Yummy and addicting ice cream.  Highly recommend these flavors:  Chocolate with Tcho Shards, Four Barrel Coffee, and Cookie Monster
pos	Best ice cream in the bay, in my opinion. Try the Four Barrel Coffee flavor. It's great! Even people who don't like coffee like this flavor.
pos	Delicious and AMAZING customer service!! Their 'allergen list' is listed for each ice cream, so it made it easy for us detect Gluten Free!!
pos	Really great ice cream.
pos	Loved the ice cream here and the service was good too. Had Mango and Strawberry Lemonade sorbet - loved them both.
pos	Great service, good basic flavours and speciality flavors. Love the fact that they are conscious about plastic use. Taste flavors without the guilt of using many plastic spoons; they use metal spoons.
neu	Yum! Great ice cream place in the Town & Country mall. Super bougie, but fitting of PA. Four Barrel coffee ice cream was great.
pos	Best ice cream I've had in the Bay area.  Love the cookie monster.  My wife also really likes the salted butterscotch.
pos	The best ice cream I have had so far. If new try the four barrel coffee or the earl grey which I find incredibly good
pos	Amazing ice cream. Locally made and ingredients at the best of the best. Great flavor combinations! It's the best ice cream in the Bay.
pos	Excellent homemade ice cream. You can taste the authentic favors of ingredients such as, mint, strawberry, cinnamon, vanilla...etc.
pos	Friendly service and creative ice cream flavor. They have more genuine sorbet flavor than I expected
pos	I only got the espresso. They pull the best shot in all of Palo alto with their four barrel beans. Perfection like a SF cafe.
neu	Ice cream is good but spoons are cheap and tend to break.  That's a shame for $6 ice cream.
pos	The ice cream texture and sweetness were good,  but I felt like some of the unusual flavors didn't live up to the hype.
pos	I love their flavors like Four Barrel coffee, Earl Gray tea, and TCHO chocolate, but the price can be pretty steep.
pos	You can sample all the unique flavors. Friendly service. Good ice cream.
pos	This ice cream is amazing! You can't go wrong with anything you order. They even have ice cream cakes.
pos	The Cookie Monster is the best!
pos	Best ice cream around! Have to go for the coffee or peanut butter brownie flavours, they are to die for!!
neu	Good ice cream but the service was lacking some manners.
neg	The ice cream  were to soft, meh taste. I would suggest salt and straw over this any day !
neu	Ordered the rich chocolate with bitter tcho chards. Thought it was only okay. The flavor was a bit weird, and then the shards were a little too bitter.
pos	Amazing ice cream place. The coffee is my favorite flavor, but even the sorvets are great!
pos	Some of the better ice cream I have had. Unfortunately, some of their better flavors are phased out.
neu	Long line, very tasty and pricey ice cream at nearly $12 for two little scoops.
pos	Best local ice cream around. Convenient location especially because it is right next to boba guys.
pos	Loved this place.  Icecream was great and the service was even better!  Tons of gluten free options.
pos	Best ice cream in the peninsula, flavors don't change much, but will definitely fill your cravings.
pos	Small batch ice cream that hits the spot. Try their 4 barrel coffee with cocoa nibs, malted milk with chocolate or the Earl grey.
pos	A little pricey but some of the best I've cream I've ever had. Try the Earl grey or Jasmine.
pos	Corn cookie is like a Mexican sugar cookie. Amazing!!!! And for vegans you are deprived of nothing. Love this place!
pos	Excellent ice cream flavors. I would recommend vanilla bean or cream with honey and balsamic
pos	My favorite place for ice cream. Earl Grey. Four barrel coffee. Be sure to sample a few before ordering.
pos	I LOVE this place! Went with my friends and they recommended the dark chocolate one. Just loved it.
pos	Excellent ice cream, only problem was that it was so popular that the line took forever!
neg	Tried orange, strawberry and rum current, nothing special. Would've given 3 stars if the guy who served us showed a little more patience.
pos	They have core flavors like the coffee that is really good but I go for the many rotating flavors.
pos	Delicious creamy ice cream. Earl grey and four barrel coffee ones are the best!
pos	Palo Alto location > Los Gatos. The shop is bigger, has much more seating area and the vibe is more friendly too 💯
pos	Great Ice Cream! If Boba Guys has a line too long, this is a great consolation.
pos	Really good ice cream with interesting flavors but PRICEY.
pos	One of the best ice creams around the South Bay...hands down!
neu	Just okay...a typical artisanal ice cream shop with average flavor combinations
neu	Ice cream is on the slightly too sweet side, it could be smoother and creamier with smaller ice crystal.
neg	This ice cream is very bland. I was very disappointed in their options. Small portions and overpriced as well.
pos	A good place to get fancy ice cream. Make sure to try before you buy.
pos	The ice cream are awesome here. We love coming here when we live in Palo Alto.
pos	Delish vegan ice cream flavor with great consistency, peanut butter chocolate chip!
pos	The Four Barrel is an absolute delight! I also like how they decorate the "kiddy" scoops for the little ones.
pos	Delicious freshly made ice cream. Puts the yum yum on every bite.
pos	Wonderful! Just wonderful ice cream, and the guy was suuuper friendly. Love this place.
pos	Pretty much the best ice cream I've ever had.
pos	Soo yummy all different exotic flavors and really cute ice cream monsters
pos	This is among the best places for ice creams in bay area. It's usually crowded and line moves slowly.
neu	It's ok the icecream here is mediocre at best. Was hoping for something like McConnell's in Santa Barbara
pos	Ice cream here is nice and smooth. Give it a try just know that there is usually a line here.
pos	Great ice cream. The coffe flavoured one an obvious favourite.
neg	Absolutely portion  size is small and the price is expensive maybe for that reason many people not come back
pos	Favorite ice cream cone & sundae place of ours when we spent our summer out there.
pos	Nice flavors, ice-cream lovers should not miss this place.
pos	Really liked the mango sticky rice sundae. Very unique.
pos	Best ice cream in the bay area!  I am picky about ice cream and these guys do it right.
pos	Great ice cream, but long line on Father's day.
pos	We stop here every time we visit Town & Country Village.  For kids, they will make a "cookie monster" serving with a smiley face and eyes.
pos	Super good ice cream, but get an appropriate amount because its rich!
pos	Best ice-cream I've tasted in the Bay Area!
pos	Best. Ice Cream. Ever! This place has amazing ice cream!
pos	Delicious ice cream. Cozy little place. Expensive for what you get.
pos	Well I mean I work here so I'm supposed to say it's good right? 5/5 scoops !
pos	So delicious! I especially liked the malted milk with milk chocolate.
pos	I come here for the Earl gray ice cream, favorite flavor in the Bay.
pos	Delicious
pos	For how crowded they always are, they get people served quickly. Also, amazing flavors.
pos	Friend recommended as the best I've cream in town. It's definitely up there.
pos	Their salted butterscotch is heavenly! Had the tin pot sundae.. Irresistible!
pos	Hands down the best ice cream place around Palo Alto.
pos	Amazing ice cream, don't miss the salted caramel.
pos	Great ice cream. Can be busy but worth the wait.
pos	Absolutely delicious and worth visiting if you are nearby. Service was great as well
pos	I was particularly impressed with the spectrum of “healthy” options and their ability to meet special requests or needs.
pos	I order strawberry lemons and dragon sherbet. Yummy
pos	Love the flavors but sad they discontinued the pretzel cones.
neg	Totally over priced.  Paid over $15 for two small ice creams.
pos	Best ice cream I've ever had, by far.

pos	Best ice cream I've ever had period!

pos	Every time I’m in Palo Alto, I make it a point to stop here.
pos	I like
neu	Got a super burrito that was really good, but the staff wouldn’t give me salsa for my burrito since you need to pay for salsa. Heads up that’s why it isn’t 5 stars for me.
neg	We ordered a delivery from this place with GrubHub. The vegetables in the food didn't look fresh so we threw it all away to avoid potential health issues.
pos	I never tried a fajita burrito before and it was really good, nice and fast customer service
neg	Tacos basically delivered as a box of the ingredients you can use to make tacos.  Some assembly required.
neg	This food tastes fine and is reasonably priced for the area but on two occasions I have gotten food poisoning from them. I've been to this place roughly 20 times total because I got to school across the street and have lunch at the town and country center. Considering that out of the relatively little amounts of time I've been to this restaurant and that I've had food poisoning from them twice should be alarming to potential customers.
pos	Service was fast and friendly. The chicken tortilla soup was flavorful but severely lacking in vegetables. The tamales were wonderfully moist, and I thought the vegetarian one had the best flavor. I would eat here again.
pos	Great quality. Yummy food. Fast turn around. Perfect choice for a quick bite right there or pick up.
pos	Delicious Mexican food. I loved the naked burritos they have.
pos	AMAZING shrimp burrito! I seem to always end up getting one. I wish they had a larger vegan protein option like tofu or beyond crumbles, etc...so I can go more often! Great spicy salsa if you're up to the challenge.
neu	12 dollars for a burrito you would be hard pressed to believe wasn't from Taco Bell. Salsa is bomb though.
pos	Delicious pozole, tacos, whole menu is tasty.
pos	This place has really great meats! All the meat I tried were flavorful, lean, and tender. Also had the chili relleno a la carte which was also delicious. Perfect amount of breading/chili/cheese ratio. I also like that they had sour cream on top. Good amount of food for the price. Definitely recommend the carnitas and barbacoa! All the five salsas offered were fresh and tasty. Four stars because customer service is so-so. Definitely going back for the great food!
neg	Ordered vegetarian burrito they added chicken in it !! When I went to the person working there he saw the meat said it’s just cheese, I asked what type of cheese? He called a lady working there she said it’s chicken; then he says we have lots of trays so food is always falling form one tray to other, I will give refund! Please be careful if you are vegetarian or vegan! They have too many trays food is always jumping as per to the lulu worker! Feeling Pathetic  and disgusted
pos	Fast, delicious, and all for a fair price
neg	Good food. However, I was looking through my bank statements and saw that I was charged twice for my food. Some of the staff are nice, but some of them don't give chips with my order (everyone else seems to get chips and this has happened twice) and then I have to ask for them.
neg	The best tacos in town if they get the order correct.  Every time I've been here I ask for everything with no onions and every time they jam pack everything with onion.  Everytime we have had to wait twice for our meal.
pos	This is AMAZING Mexican food, and very well priced for the location. I have had the mini-super burrito twice and both times it was GREAT. The Salsas are super spicy (which I love) and fresh. This is the best food in PA.
neu	The food here is good. For Palo Alto, the food is reasonably priced but for any other taqueria probably not. Also, they got my order wrong today. I ordered one bean and cheese burrito, and one al pastor street taco. What I got was one burrito with beans, al pastor, and pico -- no cheese(?). I'm not really sure how they came up with this creation when none of the substitutions were asked of me. I didn't want to waste food, and I didn't have the time to ask for them to make it again but it was a disappointing experience. Although, the food was good. Also, you are probably better taking this food to go as the birds outside the restaurant are ravenous. My burrito fell apart from the bottom and all the filling fell to my aluminum foil. So I went inside to grab a fork and when I came back out, there was a bird standing on top of my burrito so I threw the rest away. Gross. Definitely not the restaurants fault, but not something I would want to encounter again. I will take my food else where. All and all, I would visit here again, but I would make sure they have my exact order and ask them to repeat it, and I would take it to go.
pos	Having eaten here many times, I recommend their tacos with the meats seen less often on a menu:  albanil, barbacoa, and machaca.  Ordering is usually fast, but there's a service mishap about 10% of the time (forgotten item, wrong substitution, etc) and the wait to get food can be slow, especially if you get a hard-shell taco (I think they fry them to order).  Prices are reasonable given the location.
pos	Very satisfying for breakfast burritos, etc., but very expensive for what you get.  I would honestly expect to lay around 1/2.  Still, pretty tasty!
neu	Great food, highly overpriced.  $3.50 for a bottle of Snapple. $2.50 for a can of coke. & I don't mind paying $10.50 for a burrito but it should be bigger. It's called the super burrito but somehow it's the same size as their bean and cheese burrito.  I guess in Palo Alto money isn't tight so folks don't mind paying these prices.
pos	I ordered the Super Chile Rellano burrito.  It was extremely messy, but also very delicious. The highlight of the burrito was the roasted chile peppers. I would certainly come back to this place. Just don't plan to eat the food in the car or someplace where making a mess might be of concern.
neg	Used a third party to pick up and should have just ordered in person would have been faster then online and having it ready for me like it should be. Then getting there and being told it’s being worked on then ten minutes later asking me what my order is. Who runs this place is there a manager here who knows what’s going on?? Waist of time
pos	Best paly burrito ever
pos	Love the vegan grilled veggie with beans and rice super burrito. The payment and ordering system could be improved though
neu	Really good chicken, especially pollo hervido! Minus two stars because they routinely do not honor their own coupons: in one case, tried to enforce a minimum purchase requirement, and more often their Belly (rewards program) device is down so cannot redeem coupons.
neg	Overpriced and really not upto the mark. Very smartly they skip basic salsa and Gauc. Ridiculous. The food wasn’t even tasty and it’s not even authentic mexican. No Gauc, No sour cream, instead added cheese! Come on!
pos	I got the enchiladas and my boyfriend the super burrito and both were delicious. Would definitely go back.
pos	Great spot for casual and quick Mexican food. Great variety of rice, meat, vegetables, sauces, and salsa. The service at the counter is good and thorough as well.
pos	Amazing food. The salad is jam packed with goodies and the cilantro lime dressing is perfectly creamy. The little container of guac was too recieve though.
neg	Overpriced for below average Mexican food. Horrible customer service
neg	I would like to give a review; however, I never had a chance to order. I was waiting in line and by the time I got to the cashier at 7:45 PM I was told they’re closed. The operating hours say 8pm as others before me had a chance to order. No need to come back here.
pos	Good easy Mexican food. Just try to avoid the giant lines of high school kids. Also have hope that there is not a giant door dash order in front of you.
pos	Really good for such a small place - it can be hard to find a seat nearby. Their shrimp burrito was awesome, and the free salsa bar was a nice touch.
neu	It's pretty good for fast food . It was too cold to sit outside, but we took our food home and ate it was very good.
pos	The pollo asado plato was pretty good.  Service was quick.  With chips, salsa, and a Jarritos it came to $22.
neg	Ironic that its called Authentic Mexican Food. Truly unauthentic, overpriced and unflavourful food. Better restaurants around the same area. PS. We ate the burritos and nachos.
neu	Very good fast food place, the seating outside is excellent especially on a sunny day.
pos	Great Berrian tacos
pos	All of the food tastes nice! If you are in the area I recommend stopping by.
neu	Gourmet Mexican food. I would not call it authentic Mexican food. Nice people customer service it's ok.
pos	Excellent, unique offerings. Really great for for reasonable prices.
pos	It passes as up to standard for Taquerias style Mexican food. Not Bad
pos	The menu is extensive, the food is delicious and the ordering process is confusing. But worth it.
neu	OK mexican. Definitely overpriced. It also took a long time to get our food. If you're in a rush I'd look elsewhere.
pos	Kind of a long wait for food but the food makes up for it very good I recommend it highly
neu	The food is okay. I have had better Mexican food
neg	Cashier texting in a group chat during my order, I get it we need to stay in touch, or if it's important, excuse yourself for a few minutes.
neg	Good food but sometimes takes 20+ mins to get it 😩
pos	Tasty but can be slow to get your food.
neg	Tasteless, bland chicken. Unsure how this restaurant stays in business in Palo Alto.
neg	Not good at all! Found hair in seafood/shrimp tacos.
pos	Great customer service! Good food
pos	Great wonderful food.  Very good
neu	Taco tortilla is the worst kind

pos	Why do they deliver food fast 
neu	I wanted to like this place. It’s cute. It’s in Palo Alto. It serves French food.  I ordered a brie and pear sandwich. The bread was stale. The pear was unripe. The chopped walnuts were raw. (Why not at least a subtle roast to bring out the inherent sugar?) It was a cacophony of textures and tastes.  And then there’s the curious case of the avocado toast, which tasted like a toasted piece of Safeway bread and a lifeless avocado.  I’ll be back to make sure it wasn’t just a bad day. But — gosh — this wasn’t the gastronomic experience I was hoping for.
neg	Was craving for sweet pastry, and stopped here because of good reviews. Interior is cute and it has outdoor sitting( which is why it gets extra star) BUT! 1. Got croissants, and they mixed up my order and instead of almond ones they gave me something else that i didn’t want! And it tasted average 2. Got 2-3 different eclairs, and all of them were not fresh. Cream was fine, but the dough was so stiff and tasted like 3-5 days old pastry  Unfortunately i won’t be back here, and if you end ip going, ask if it is freshly baked before you order anything !
pos	Part of the Town & County village. This café has an excellent selection of cakes, pastries, coffee and teas.  The service was pleasant. Plenty of both indoor and outdoor seating.
pos	Love this bakery. Their baked goods and croissants are a must here. So delicious especially when they're fresh out the oven
pos	Fabulous pastries and delicious sandwiches to totally enjoy.  The cinnamon apple creeps are the feature dish, a must have!
neg	Never have been here before, and never again. Service was good, but this is Not a $10.00 sandwich. This was a to go order so I didn’t see what was in the box until I got back to the hospital. Wilted lettuce, small slices of Roma tomato, cheese was translucent so thinly sliced, and where was the turkey? The meat looked like 2 Land of Frost packaged Turkey meat. The pastries are good , but when you want a sandwich for lunch and this is what you end up with, well , a picture is worth a thousand words.  As a side note: I received a reply from “the owner”, just to let you know , it’s really sad that you feel the necessity to reply to every poor review your establishment receives, no I didn’t like you “fresh” sandwich, and I was the manager of a Boulangerie for  years. I also worked with a well known pastry chef. SO, my review was not exaggerated…Picture speaks for its self. No worries Buddy, as I said I will not be returning to your shop. No snarky reply is necessary, let’s just part friends.
pos	Been coming here for almost 20 years and consistently just a great bakery! I know they offer breakfast and lunch food items but I haven’t tried them before. I can only speak to their desserts which are phenomenal!!  High quality, great service. Highly recommend!
pos	Great breakfast options and fresh orange juice! Everything is tasty here.
neu	Cute patio with French vibes and a great selection of sinful deserts, crepes and brunch items. Enjoyed the fresh orange juice and coffee was marginally better than Starbucks. Poached eggs were overcooked, the bread was old and the sweet crepe could have had more nutella. Overall, recommended for brunch or coffee on a date or otherwise, but I had a better experience at Mademoiselle Colette.
pos	Good vibe, fine coffee. We tried their croissant sandwich. Portion is enough for one person.
neg	The avocado toast needs to be improved for the price point. It's literally just on a piece of regular white bread. There is no olive oil, lemon, salt or pepper, and it's like $8. Very disappointing. The desserts looked great though. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing but still.
pos	Just a wonderful place in the town and country mall. Lots of outdoor seating and chill vibes. And the service people are so gracious.
pos	Good cappuccinos and good breakfast items.  I have ordered the breakfast sandwich a few items - and not been disappointed.  The service is friendly and they bring food items to the table.  Plenty of outdoors seating
pos	Dropped by for an early breakfast. The breakfast sandwich consists of a croissant, egg and ham with a side of fruit. It was warm and hearty. Picked up an almond bear claw as a snack for later. It a little sweet but delicious nonetheless.
pos	I rated Douce France under Town and Country. Excellent French cuisine from the onion soup to the quiche to the coffee. Authentic French food. Beautiful tarts, petit- fours, croissants, palmiers, sandwich au jambon(ham on a baguette,),etc. It was difficult to choose!
neg	Usually good but quite disappointing this time and the customer service was terrible. I visit this bakery whenever I am in the area as your sandwiches are nice and their coffee is good as well. This time when I went by, I got a pear and brie sandwich, Unfortunately this was to go and I wasn’t sitting there to eat it when I got home and opened the box the sandwich was literally only bread. There was one really thin slice of pear in it, and literally a smidgen of bread, the sandwich was super dry and had no sort of flavour whatsoever. When I called the Bakery to give them some feedback, as a person on the phone was very abrupt and said that items were made fresh in the bakery so he’s not sure how that could have even happened but there was nothing I could do about it except if I would come back all the way, which was about six miles at that point, and they would take a look at it His tone did suggest that it would not make any difference to him, and even when I offered to send him a picture, he said pictures are so judgemental and it’s up to each person‘s interpretation While I understand that this happens once in awhile, you can’t be perfect all the time, the customer service really up to me as I was expecting a better response especially having gone there so many times and given them so much business
pos	The guys here were great. They really talk up the food! The food & coffee was good, but not incredible. Its a good option and ill probably be back. Eggs Benedict was perfect. Breakfast sandwich was hot and protein packed. The tart seemed day old or so.
pos	Simple breakfast sandwich done right. ✔️ yass!
pos	Wanted an excellent chocolate chip cookie and got an excellent chocolate chip cookie. Even though they were closed, they opened the door to our knock and graciously sold us one. Earlier, a few doors down, Antoine’s was open, but at the counter I was told “sorry, we ran out of cookies”. Apparently, Antoine, the owner, doesn’t really care, as his response to my negative response was to laugh it off. Running out of dough is not a laughing matter.
pos	Best, most authentic French pastries around in a convenient place.  Love the eggs Benedict also.
pos	We usually come for breakfast and order Norwegian crepe, avo toasts and some pastries. I have to admit, food quality declined over the years, that's the reason I'm downgrading my review from 5* to 4*
pos	Delicious crepes and croissant. Overall, good taste and not too sweet. The banana and Nutella crepe is super delicious with the whipped cream being very fresh and satisfying. The savory one is good too while I feel it can integrate the taste of artichokes, tomato and basil better.
neg	Definitely not. I am French and this place is surely not so. Edible, nice patio, friendly staff. But the baguette is absolutely not acceptable- no better than cheap supermarket quality. Eggs are edible, but little flavor, blend. Presentation is more than basic. Pastries are overly sweet, “Americanized” and not delicate and flavorful as French pastries should be.
pos	Love at first bite. The French baking technique really shows at Douce France and my taste buds enjoy it very much. This is a great spot for delicious baked goodies, small plates, coffees, and teas. My wife and I shared the pan au chocolat (chocolate croissant). It tasted like it was baked earlier that morning in Nice. I am a fan of macchiatos (espresso, not Starbucks) and my wife enjoys lattes. Both beverages were masterfully crafted. I will definitely be returning for leisurely Saturday mornings.
pos	Solid place for some French pastries or breakfast abs sandwiches. We ordered a Croque Madame and an mushroom Omelet. Both were tasty. Sitting outside on a sunny warm Sunday was very relaxing.
pos	Wide variety of offerings so it’s really hard to pick one item… So why strain yourself? ;) I had a really flavorful and natural tasting sour cherry tarte. I say natural because it wasn’t goopy cherry from a can but something you can tell was artfully created for the customer’s enjoyment. The chocolate croissant was basically out of a dream. Had the lemon poppyseed muffin as well and only that was less then enticing. The lemon flavor was so late it was almost like standard yellow cake. Maybe a little extra zest or lemon oil would do the trick? But the customer service was fantastic. Very attentive. Thank you!
pos	One of my favorite places of all time. The latte is amazing!!! The staff is so friendly and customers are great everyday ordinary people. The outdoor seating is perfect to enjoy the sun!!
pos	Place is good i had a pastry shaped like a heart ♥️ which was yum and had a latte 😍😍
pos	The crossaint egg sandwich is fantastic. The place is amazingly clean and the staff is very respectable and helpful. Facilities clean. Americano was the right strength. I highly recommend this place to early birds as they open doors at 7:00 am. So for sure, best early breakfast option in Palo Alto.
pos	Very pleasant, with courteous and helpful staff. One can almost imagine being on a boulevard in Paris with a glass of wine and a 'friandise'. The confections overshadow some serious food. Try the salmon sandwich. Bon appetite.
neu	Cozy and cozy ambience. Good service. Fruits were fresh and warm food were flavorful. Eclair wasn't fresh though.
neg	Got a cookie, pain au chocolat, and lemon mousse cake. All 3 were easily the worst examples of their kind I've had in a long time.
neg	They messed up the order, and do not have consistency with portions.  Later I found a Peet's Coffee exists close by so you have an alternative
neu	Enjoyed sitting on a bench, drinking my coffee and eating my bear claw. But the latte was mediocre and the bear claw didn’t have much filling
neu	Lol bummed that I paid 3-4 bucks for what i’m pretty sure was a pre frozen baguette. Not a bit of crunch to the crust. Why are they selling these? I could’ve just gone to trader Joe’s if I wanted to buy a supermarket baguette. The pastries I bought looked great so looking forward to those. 🤞  Update: The pastries were very nice. Will be back for those.
pos	Great place ! I enjoyed a chai latte ( better than any other coffee place ) with a sweet crepe !!!!!
pos	Cappuccino and sanduíches there is amazing. The Atendente’s make very good job.
pos	We love this place. I remember when it opened and it's great to know it's still around. Items are affordable and there's a great variety. Love the complimentary little biscotti that comes with coffee drinks. But nowadays we get items to go or delivered. With delivery orders they always call us about substitutions, which is very thoughtful.  We like that they have mini versions of their croissants, and especially enjoy their ham and cheese, and chocolate. Their palmiers and millefeuille are tasty when fresh. For lunch their savory crepes and side salads are wonderful - filling but not overly so. We are grateful that Douce France has been around so long and we look forward to more of their goodies.
pos	Good French bakeries. Shrinkflation is applied here too. Napoleon cake used to be the whole piece. Now, whole piece is divided into 3 small pieces, ($3/piece). They make more money this way.
pos	Lavazza coffee!! Great coffee, nice home cooked lunch. Prices reasonable. Quiet locale in an open air collection of stores. Patio. Independent family owned, it seems. Good vibes and nicely old school.
pos	Always lovely staff and my fave chocolate croissants!
pos	Beautiful and delicious cake. Go for something chocolaty like chocolate mousse. Nice and attentive staffs as well
pos	Very friendly staff! The Croissant and Crepe we had were reason enough to keep coming back. The croissant's are of the highest quality and the crepe sauce was fantastic. The Beet Salad and French Onion soup did not warrant of a 5 star rating but I would still order them again.
pos	Consistent amazing food and service! Been coming here for over 10 years!  One of my comfort foods is their salami and cheese sandwich.  Son enjoyed his smoked salmon sammy and my mom loved her ham and cheese with beet salad.  For dessert we each got a tart and was gifted some baby macrons.  Thank you Douce France staff for a good end to our Gray Friday!😝
pos	They have everything sweet and savory. you get the best service ever and staff is kind and caring
pos	I don’t know how I missed out on this place. On a recommendation from a friend we met for breakfast recently and it was fantastic! I could smell the wonderful coffee before I even walked up to the cafe. Dined outside. Selections all looked great. Look forward to going back!
pos	Great coffee and amazing croissants.  Kitchen cooks a great breakfast.  Staff is super friendly.  Excellent cakes and desserts as well.  Cecilio and Armando are fantastic batista's.
pos	This is a lovely hidden gem! Has a charming French style with a local touch.
neu	Prime location.  Outdoor seating.  Chocolate croissant was delicious but tiny, plus expensive.  Service about as warm as I would expect as an American in Paris, although the guy behind the counter was likely from San Jose.
neu	Decent coffee. Underwhelming croque madame. Well dressed mixed greens salad.
neg	Nice displays. Good amount  of dining seats.  The time it took for them to cook my panini was at least 20 minutes and all other customers had received their meal . When I got it there was a few pieces of arugula and one or two other items in the sandwich. It should have looked more appetizing and like it wasn't thrown together . Especially because of the time I waited to get it  There was enough time to make it right. Expensive --which is typical of most French restaurants and French shops in general .
neu	Food here is usual bakery things. I got croissant which did not seem that fresh and coffee was fine. The people here are not that friendly and you better decide your order before entering the store else you would get some stares from the staff for wasting their time.
pos	Hot chocolate is average, macchiato is good. Go for the chocolate croissant.
pos	I have been to this bakery for many years, and am happy to say it is a truly special place with the best of offerings in food and desserts (a bit on the pricey side, but worth it). Whether quiche, croissants, cakes, tarts, or marsipan, I have never been disappointed with what I have ordered.  Everyone is friendly, and if you go here often enough, they start to remember you.
pos	French-style cafe/bakery, fairly no frills. Their food has been consistently good for years now. I prefer their buckwheat savory crepes which are kind of unusual to find in the area, but everything is good and there's something for most palates. They're also very reasonably priced for a French style place in Palo Alto 😉...  They tend to be fairly busy regardless time of day, but it can be a zoo during lunch hour as all the high school kids and Stanford and PAMF people seem to enjoy the food here as well.
pos	My fave place for brunch on the weekend! Huge menu, friendly staff who has gotten to know me,  and a relaxing vibe. I always get the breakfast sandwich in a croissant, it is the best!!!
neg	not good coffee.  and the food is not great
pos	Very good food. I love this Cafe, because it offers a full breakfast or lunch. Service is great and not overly expensive, which is what you generally find in this shopping center - because we are in Palo Alto, in front of Stanford 😋 That being said, the atmosphere is an interesting mix of old money (rich "people") and millennials (mostly Stanford students of all races, creeds, sex, and social status). However, this works perfectly. Every blue moon, you'll see someone speak French - LoL. I love it.
pos	I've been here many times and LOVE it. My go-to is the La Savanne crepe. I am also obsessed with their nutella croissants. I've ordered several other menu items and have enjoyed them all. On top of that, the service has always been great. I love that you can order on the phone and pick up, too.
pos	Great croissants, friendly environment, good food.
neg	The food here was gross. Ordered two quiches and both were stale. We asked for a refund or a different quiche and the whole staff insisted on trying our quiche. After trying it they said that "nothing was wrong with it." It was extremely rude. We went to to buy two different quiches as the manager said he would give us a different price. He took $1 dollar off of the price. I am EXTREMELY disappointed and will CERTAINLY not be eating here again. The food is DISGUSTING and stale. Town and Country offers many different places with better food.
pos	Prosciutto crepe was really good and the sandwich with the egg on top was amazing. The brioche was so soft, yet crunchy on the edges. The pancakes were interesting, but too dry.
pos	Service was quick on a busy Saturday.  The food was tasty and the coffee well made. If I lived in the area I'd definitely make it a favorite
pos	Great baked good specially their chocolate mousse cake.
pos	Charming Cafe with a broad menu. Order and pay at the counter and then they bring your food to your table. Quick service. Delicious food. Every day French food, pastry, coffee, wine. Seating inside and on the sidewalk.
pos	#ChocolateChipCookie!!! I'm not normally one who likes sweets. But I needed to get some pastries for an event the next day and was hungry so I got a cookie just to hold me over. WOW I was blow away by how good this cookie was! I dragged about it to my friends who have a sweet tooth and they liked it too.
pos	The food and the cafe vibe are good. Services are very friendly too.
pos	I don't understand why it's taken me so long to find this wonderful place! Now that I have, I am a constant customer. I want to work my way straight through their lovely menu starting with the onion soup! I love everything about this cafe and quite understand why it's so popular.  Please don't go away.
pos	Great espresso and baked goods. Staff were rude until it was time to tip. Ample outdoor tables but no heat lamps.
neu	I ordered the French Onion Soup and a seasonal fruits crepe. Both were just average, nothing exciting. It appears to be a good meet up place or a place for an afternoon coffee break or to grab a quick bite.
pos	One of my favorite tucked away spots in palo alto to sit with a book enjoy a panini (Alina is my favorite) and a latte. And I'm not normally a huge fan of sweets or pastries, but it's awesome that they give you a complimentary delicious tiny pastry with a lunch order.
pos	Had a chocolate croissant and a small cappuccino and really enjoyed both. It did have an everyday European cafe vibe. Surprisingly busy for midmorning on a weekday, but seating opened up within a few minutes.
pos	It's my wife and my "go to" lunch place.  It's got a European feel and the service is friendly.  Most of the staff is long-serving and knowledgeable.  Love the pastries, sandwiches, daily specials and salads.
neg	Very disappointing. The onion soup was nothing more than limp onions, a sprinkle of Gruyere cheese (did I spell that correctly?), dirty water and a couple of floating pieces of soggy bread. After biting several times into the apricot croissant I still wasn't able to find the apricot. This place is nothing more than fluff sold to Stanford liberals as "sophisticated food" at sky high prices. You can do better with Costco free samples.
neg	Food is on par with a mediocre diner, and that's probably generous. Deserts are not made on side, they simply don't have the space or crafsftmanship to actually make any of the pastries you can buy there. Coffee is atrocious, it's undrinkable. Waste money if you will. There are far better places to go in this area.
pos	Douce France is a great place to meet for coffee or a bite to eat. They have made the transition into the post-Coronavirus reality with panache, and it is still a good and safe place to hang out!
pos	Great vibe, tasty espresso, friendly staff with genuine smiles on their faces. But most importantly ... NO AIR CONDITIONING! Kudos to Douce France for this. There is no reason to turn a cafe into a blast chiller in California in May, like so many others do. Thank you!
pos	Their chocolate cake was great
pos	If you are looking for French or Italian bread, try this place. The panino I ordered (20 minutes before closing) was better than many I had in Italy. Of course in Italy you might know where to find a professional panino that's better than this, but this is by far the best I have had in the US. There is a passion for food that can be felt.
pos	This place has always been my go to for meetings nearby. Try the Croque Madame if you're okay with ham.  For me....this is a tiny taste of home.
pos	Girlfriend has never been to California and we stopped in my home town. We got a box of pastries, very reasonably priced, enjoyed every single one!
pos	Pleasant place for a morning coffee and a little bite of something. Furnished in Parisian cafe style makes it quite charming. Seating capacity acceptable, but could be a problem at peak times.
neg	I placed a special order by phone , when I go to pick it up was not the correct order. The cashier accepts their mistake, apologizes and offers me a discount. I didn’t really care about the price, but knowing that what I was buying was not really what I wanted/ had ordered. When the manager (Victor ) realizes that the cashier had offered me a discount, he got angry with his own employee and scolds him in front of everyone , saying that if I did not accept the product,  it could have sold it any ways. The embarrassed cashier offered to pay for the difference out of his salary. Sadly, the manager (Victor, who took the order) never care about customer satisfaction and much less to humiliate those who help him. Is not worth to support buying places where you can see such situations. Since then;  Trader Joe's has become a better and cheaper option for me. I'm sorry for the cashier, he was a nice young man.
pos	Douce provides French pastries, coffees and teas, and light lunches and breakfast. The service is consistently friendly, efficient, and the food is excellent value. This is a relaxing place where they don't hassle you.
pos	Great ready made pastries, if your a fan you won't be disappointed in their affogato.
pos	Awesome cafe! Yummy crepes and pastry. Cappuccino tastes like it should do. I wish they had more space - it's often gets very packed
neg	The pastries were good overall although the service staff really lacked warmth and could not even be bothered to look you in the eye when taking orders. Would say there really better places to go.
neu	Had mozzarella and tomatoes salad. Service was quick but salad was nothing special and rather on a small side. And bagette which I got with my salad was not even close to bagettes I had in France.
pos	Good coffee
neu	Douce was ok, I got there soup du jour - French union, nothing special.
pos	Chill place for Sunday afternoon!
neu	Laminated dough was overproofed and didn't taste fresh. French bakery should have better croissants.
pos	Classic French Cafe and Bakery. It's the real deal. Always a great experience here.
pos	My favorite for Cafe au lait served on a bowl and the best coffee éclair in the bay area. You can indulge with their mini éclairs.
pos	Went to a Christmas party with food from La Douce France. The best appetizers I’ve ever eaten and an amazing cake that looked like a Christmas tree made of cream puffs covered with slivers of toffee.
pos	Love the French cafe. Ideal for breakfast and lunch with a great selection of fruit tarts.
pos	*Not* gluten-free friendly. (It's a regular bakery--what can you expect?) Still, the cafe au laits and lattes are divine as are the pastries (from when I could eat them).
pos	go-to area for good coffee, pastries, or casual lunch. Crepes are the best available in Palo Alto (by a wide margin).
neu	Mediocre Eggs Benidict and coffee. Pleaaent outdoor seating. Good service.
pos	Good pear and brie sandwich on a warm baguette and a salad. Nice laptop friendly environment with small tables for quick meetings.
pos	Nice place Had a fresh good dandwich.
neu	I went for breakfast since the Coupa Cafe situated nearby was closed for the holiday. I got a chocolate pastry and the cappuccino: both were mediocre.
pos	The food is fantastic and we love your quiche Lorraine.....We also love being right next door to the best smelling bakery around!!
pos	If you want a Chocolate Croissant that is out of this world this is the place, it will not disappoint.
neu	Good food.  The service is poor.  My order wasn't taken correctly.  I had to correct them twice and once I had to get my money back for extra items they charged me incorrectly.  The table next to me also had their orders mixed up. I'll probably comeback again for food but will keep an eye on the service.
pos	Amazing food! We tried their Crespeou omelette and La savanna crepe. They both were so good!
pos	Love this place for coffee, pastries, & breakfast or lunch! A little taste of France in Palo Alto! Bien fait!
pos	Great place for a quick bite and some of the best pastries in Bay Area! Highly recommended!
pos	Excellent place for a light lunch Charcuterie and pastries good. Had another excellent lunch here today - shrimp & niçoise salad - mmm!
pos	Real French croissant and very good coffee. By real I mean they're not oversized and very tasty. Gets crowded.
pos	Place to sit down and enjoy a peaceful brunch on a weekend :) Excellent crepes, pastries and espresso.
neu	A bit disappointing that the chocolate eclairs did not feel they were cooked the same day and filled with regular vanilla cream patissiere instead of chocolate one.
pos	My go to cafe. Excellent food and among the best chai lattes anywhere in the bay
pos	Nice place for a cup off coffee and a pastry! Also have nice breakfast bites
pos	The staff is super friendly and good at what they do.  They have great Chia tea lattes and breakfast! Fun location as well!
pos	I'm so glad they put a big tent outside and I can be here safely without worrying about Covid 19.
pos	Very good baguette. Their selection of vegetarian sandwiches are good as well.
pos	Excellent pastries. Small, tasty menu. Great ambience. Reasonable prices. All around winner.
pos	They offer good coffee as well as delicious pastry :)

pos	The food is fantastic and we love your quiche Lorraine.....We also love being right next door to the best smelling bakery around!!
neu	Nice little cafe with good food. Portions aren't the biggest but they will be enough to hold you down for a meal.
pos	Too sugary for my taste and more American style than French in my eyes.
pos	The latte was very flavorful and not overly sweet.
pos	I have been going to Douce France for years. Today we enoyed sweet crêpes and good coffee.
pos	They have the best pain au chocolat like ever.
pos	Friendly service! The sandwiches and latte were lovely.
pos	Great service. We loved the veggie sandwich. Tastes just like it is in France

pos	Nice pastries
pos	The French crepe meal uses a lot of ingredients, and the filling tastes layered. The omelette was beautifully shaped and tasted great. The dining space is not large, but the environment is comfortable and relaxing. 
neg	Very disappointed with my galette des rois... the frangipane is not one, it's a pastry cream, not the texture at all of the traditional frangipane, not the color... $40 wasted.

pos	Boba is cooked to perfection and has a tasty sweet flavor and the perfect amount of chewiness. The drinks are good, but their staple is definitely the boba. Bob's Guys have a decent selection of drinks, but the neat thing about this place is customizations. Service is fast, even when they are busy, so don't be intimidated by the line because I'll probably go by quick.
pos	Great boba drinks! I enjoyed the caffeine free tea, something that's quite rare! Great taste but a little on the sweet side even at 50% (recommended sweetness level)
pos	If you're in the Stanford Mall area and jonesing for a boba, skip the Starbucks and go a little bit further to Town and Country Village outdoor Mall and you'll find Boba guys there. I've been here a few times already and every drink I've had so far had been carefully crafted and ingredient combinations considered.  5/5 Coffee boba. I needed a caffeine kick so went with the coffee boba. I also added almond jelly and substituted the milk for almond milk. The coffee was not too watery considering I loaded my drink with alot of extra stuff inside and it still gave me that beany coffee taste.  3/5 Interior. Well I really love the decorations inside and all the Boba swag is fun .. however they didn't have much room for indoor seating other than a bar up against the window. I've seen this place completely crowded on the weekends.. luckily I came towards the end of the day on Sunday and no one was there.
pos	Like the choice of alternative milk, and customization (here I concocted a hojicha strawberry with almond milk!). Drink a bit on the sweeter side despite asking for less strawberry syrup. Otherwise very good quality drink!
pos	This was my first time trying their signature strawberry matcha latte. I can see why it is a popular pick as the sweetness of the strawberry goes really well with the matcha. Even with a longer line, service is fast.
pos	Classic, always good! Perfect consistency boba. They had no pastries in stock at 1pm on a Sunday though :(
pos	Great selection of drinks, not only are they well made and customizable the boba is very very well cooked. The name boba guys fits well as the drink combined with the boba make it fantastic.
pos	The Boba Guys pretty much has that excellent drink experience consistent in all their branches from what I noticed. However, this location does stay pretty crowded most of the time and nearby it can be hard at times to find outdoor seating since there is no in door seating. So it would be best to keep in mind those things before planning a trip there.
pos	This boba is amazing, order online and pick up or order in person is super fast, and friendly service ,  and you found always parking near by.  You have to try  it !!!  I’m happy to get my boba there .
pos	Got a strawberry matcha latte, and you could tell the strawberry sauce was made with real strawberries. Love to see the non-dairy options, too.
neg	Fabulous boba. Two of four drinks ordered were messed up. Ice when none was requested. Non-dairy used instead of half & half, making it inedible for the person that it was ordered for. No ice beverage was very weak. Normally a decent place. I hope this is a one-off.
pos	The boba is sweetened which is delightful and not many boba places do this. Their menu had a good variety but too much where it overwhelms you. Had great tea, coffee, and fresca options. I got the black sugar hojicha late with boba. Delicious! Baristas were as sweet as the boba they make!
pos	Really good boba. The variety is less then the teaspoon closer to me and the line is always out the door but I got the hibiscus mint boba tea and it was great.
neu	Decent boba in ok location. Busy shopping plaza makes this shop stressful to visit. Parking very tight on weekends and afternoons. Boba branded products (shirts, bags, mugs) not great quality and very overpriced. Being a trendy shop you can expect a wait, though not really worth it. Given they are so busy the shop is about quantity and not quality of drinks.
pos	I came here with my little sisters. The staff was so friendly and I ordered the horchata boba that changed my life. It was so good.
pos	One of the best boba places in the bay! Great drinks and customer service, always consistent. If you ever go here try their strawberry matcha latte! They have a wide range of milk options to accompany everyone's needs, or if anyone is feeling adventurous. Oat milk in their boba drinks is pretty good!
pos	Tried the matcha strawberry, the sweetness was great. The green tea flavor was lacking but the strawberry puree was yummy. Long line today.
pos	Boba Guys is unlike any other bubble tea. Once you come here, you won't want to go anywhere else to get bubble tea.  We got Boba Guys when we were visiting San Francisco. After traveling around California, we went out of our way to come here one last time before we left the bay area.  This time we tried horchata and a black sesame latte both with boba. I really appreciate that they offer caffeine free options. Both of these were amazing. I don't know if I could pick a favorite.  The boba is amazing, the drinks are amazing, and this company is amazing. Don't miss out!
pos	I'm so excited there's a Boba guys closer to me! There is generally a line, especially at night, but it's worth it for high-quality Boba. Seasonal flavors change a couple times a year; soft opening hours until February 2
pos	Great, fresh tasting boba drinks at a fairly good value! The milk tea came standard with oat milk instead of regular, a stark but positive advantage over other drink locations which tend to charge more. Staff was friendly and only had a short wait to get the drinks prepared. Bike racks are available nearby; great location to bike to from Stanford campus.
pos	Oh ho ho ho ho I did not know there was a boba guys in Palo Alto. I did not know I didn't have to face SF traffic and parallel parking horrors for my strawberry matcha latte. Cute little crochet milk teas also I'm front of the cash register hahaha. I love y'all boba guys can y'all come to Sacramento?
pos	Good boba tea, friendly service, and decent wait times. My only complaint would be the price
pos	A refined menu compared to some other shops which results in a quality drink no matter what you order. A cozy interior, friendly staff, and quick service all add to a welcoming experience every visit
pos	I went to Boba Guys for the first time today. I’ve waited a few months till the lines died down. 11 am on a weekday is the perfect time to go-boba just finished cooking and no lines! I had the Strawberry Matcha Latte with boba and a Mochi blueberry donut. The donut was gluten free and had a very yummy chewy texture. The boba was perfectly cooked and I loved the flavor of the strawberry matcha. I will definitely be back to try more flavors.
pos	Fantastic only have these drinks at Vietnamese restaurants didn't take a picture but I'm definitely going to go back and leave a better review than the short one
pos	As someone that doesn't typically find boba appealing... this place smells GREAT.    And everyone there seemed really happy with their drinks.
pos	Long line and I prefer my boba a little softer, but the drink was wonderful and I was able to buy a reusable bubble tea mug. And they have free stickers ane post cards. Love them!
pos	Exceptional tea, friendly and helpful staff. I’m no Boba connoisseur, but I enjoyed my Matchata (Matcha Horchata) more than most bubble tea that I’ve had before. I went right before closing time (no line!), and the staff was super-friendly. When they noticed my hesitation while choosing a tea, they offered suggestions and also offered to replace my drink if I wasn’t satisfied with my flavor choice.
neg	The classic boba tea tasted very bland, can't taste any tea. Boba is not soft.
pos	We tried their matcha latte bubble tea with tapioca and it’s great
pos	Best boba in the Bay Area! I personally recommend the Jasmine Tea and Thai Tea.  5/5 Boba 5/5 Service 5/5 Location
pos	Best boba I've ever tried. Coffee and boba together? Yes! The black sesame latte is also amazing. Can't wait to try the double horchata.
pos	Serving both classic milk tea and creative tea drinks. Waiting line is always quite long which about 15-20mins.
pos	I love boba tea. A large sélection of drinks to choose from with different flavors. One can choose the level of sweet and the type of boba. If you want your drink cold or hot. I like tarp root flavor with a green tea. It is a good mix of tart and sweet'  The place is clean and it has a friendly staff. The prices are reasonable. This is a good place to pick up a desert after a lunch or dinner.
pos	- I usually visit once a week, and the drink variety is by far the number one thing that keeps me coming back. That being said, I am partial to the rose milk tea :) - Most milk teas have a vegan milk option, which is great (notable exception being the Thai Milk Tea). - Drinks are generally not too sweet, if you order at 50% or below. - The boba is not bad, but is by no means the best. - I wish there was an option for adjustable ice!
pos	Happy to know they have boba guys in Palo Alto! Tried their horchata and was delicious. My friend on the other hand tried the dirty horchata and does not recommend it at all. She said it tastes like burnt milk 🥛
pos	Really yummy boba! Everyone was super excited when it finally opened in Town and Country, and once it did, Boba Guys EXPLODED. You really need to be smart about when you come, too. I've seen lines go all the way to the CVS entrance, it can be a little frustrating (do NOT come on weekdays in the afternoon especially around lunch time, highschooler's flood in).Yet, I'm still rating 5 stars since it isn't their fault it gets so crowded and shouldn't be held against them. One recommendation would be to broaden the hours if possible? Over all, the boba is HIGH quality. Boba guys is like The Counter or Wahl Burger of boba and places like T4 and Teaspoon (boba fanatic here if you can't already tell) are the Mcdonalds of milk tea and boba. I love how much you are able to tweak your drink too! I always order with chia seeds, less ice, and extra boba, haha. It's also OK prices and they offer free stickers. Staff are generally nice and give good advice is you're having troubles picking the many options.

neg	The place didn't seem very busy, The person  who took our order was friendly. Then the wheels fell off. We waited for 26 minutes to get our order: 2 teas with boba. They weren't even milk tea.... I mean really guys .... It looked like the workers were busy the whole time, but they were only bringing it drinks every 4-5 minutes. It seems like they have no systems in place for efficiency. We were late to our appointment because we didn't expect to wait so long. This is not the place to come if you are on your lunch break. Oh and the boba! The boba tasted just like instant boba - too firm and not very delicious.  I was disappointed to see that boba guys is coming to Santana Row. I hope my experience was a fluke. I will give the new location a try when it opens.
pos	This place has forever raised the bar for me. Went her because a friend suggested this place while I was in San Francisco. Got the Ube milk tea with boba and it was pretty darn good. Boba wasn't too sweet, just the right level of chewy and the flavor of the ube milk tea was impeccable. We went on a weekday and didn't expect the place to be crowded. We had to wait for 10-15 minutes after ordering but it is totally worth the wait. Def going back whenever I visit the bay area.
pos	Been a lover of Boba Guys since my first time trying the strawberry matcha latte. More recently I’ve been hooked on the Ube Latte with boba. It’s so silky smooth, delicious, and a beautiful lavender color. The workers are friendly, and the online ordering makes picking up easy
pos	THE best! I happened to be in the area and I've been wanting to try Boba Guys for forever, so I had to get one. It did not disappoint at all, seriously the best boba I've ever had. I got the Horchata with boba, my only regret is not getting the bigger size. I ordered via the website and they were super busy but the wait was more than manageable. Chef's kiss to the Boba Guys <3
pos	Their tea is amazing. High quality ingredients and super friendly staff!
pos	I always stop by when I visit the Bay. The drinks are amazing, especially the Korean banana milk. I can't match the flavor anywhere else I go. It's usually busy here but I always order ahead online. It's very simple and quick.
pos	Must have recently opened and the locals havent experienced before because there was no line on a Saturday morning??
neg	Inaccurate ETAs that often waste 45 mins of customers’ times. The boba is amazing and the drinks are great (minus the weird spices in the seasonal drinks) but lying to customers about the wait times is a major inconsideration. They’re often understaffed and both for online and in person orders give customers inaccurate wait times.
pos	We got the Horchata coffee and Matcha, which both had a really good unique flavor. Would come again!
pos	Every time I have ordered here it has been delicious. My favorite boba tea I have had. Highly recommend horchata drink. Never had an issue with waiting either when ordering ahead on the app.
pos	So excited for BOBA GUY near South Bay. It is great as usual. But still having a long line for newly opening.
neu	Boba Guys makes unique, high-quality drinks. Five stars here.  My problem is with the pickup system. The last couple of times I've been here I've had to wait for 5-10 minutes, staring through the window at the drinks that I already paid for, watching the ice melt, waiting to get the attention of one of the employees.  And this is all while new orders are being taken. Taking on as many orders as possible may maximize profits in the short term, but it can really frustrate your customers and impact you in the long term. Totally anecdotal, but I sometimes find myself wanting to avoid Boba Guys just to not have to deal with the web order pickup.  Boba Guys is the only boba shop I've seen that does this. I've run approximately zero businesses in my life and yet I'm completely certain that this is the wrong way to do things. It's significantly more frustrating to wait 5 minutes to get your already-prepared and paid for drink handed to you than to wait an extra minute to put your order in.  This totally isn't meant to be tongue-in-check: have the Boba Guys owners actually tried ordering at one of their shops? It's not a great experience.
pos	I go here every Friday and their boba tea is amazing I wish they had a ice option for the Thai tea tho the ice is way too much and they should have better options for that also bringing  back some of the flavors like Masala chai I miss it :(
pos	I always get the strawberry fresca. Boba is soft and yummy. 4 stars since they took away online ordering .
pos	Boba guys has a great online system for ordering and picking up your drinks. It’s quick and efficient. I had a horchata milk tea with boba. Make sure you mix up the boba before your first drink as the syrup at the bottom of the cup is really sweet.
pos	The boba is very chewy but not too hard or too soft, perfectly made. The classic black is okay, balanced tea and milk.
pos	Boba Guys is the one. And strawberry matcha latte is my girl. In all seriousness though, it's great! You can order ahead, even without it they have very speedy service, the quality of the tea and boba is unwavering, and they have compostable straws! What's not to like, I ask.
pos	Takes a little long to get your stuff, but it's really good and its close to Stanford.
pos	Seems like everyone likes this place. Tried it for the first time, pretty solid milk tea.
pos	Good boba, lousy cups. My expresso boba was spilling all over the place and unfortunately in my (employer's) car due to an issue with the lid. I understand it's better for the environment but I was tasting a bit of the paper from the straw. The ordering is pretty simple and fast by scanning the barcode and inputting some info in your phone. A bit on the pricey side.
pos	Boba guys really nails the texture and flavor of boba! Their beverages are also quite exceptional, making their drinks fantastic! I leave the place satisfied with my drink, not feeling too guilty for consuming something too sweet. Highly recommend!
pos	Good location, love the interior and exterior sign: it is very minimal and clean. Note: there is almost always a long line that you have to wait 10-25 minutes in. The menu is short but good, especially the popular "strawberry  matcha" drink. Service is friendly and fast. More on the pricier side of boba, but worth it.
neu	Be prepared to wait 20-30 minutes for your drink, even on a weekday afternoon. I just saw 3 door dash drivers walk off because they didn't want to keep waiting, and one even complained to the manager but there's nothing they can or will do about the slowness.
neu	Idk why they’re so popular. They have like 5 drinks and their tea isn’t exactly the best. Lots of sugar and the wait time to a tea averages 15-40mins depending on whether its a weekday or weekend. They’re still not open indoors so most people order through the mobile app and they get really backed up. Teaspoon pwns this place.
pos	This place is located next to Tin Pot Creamery within the Town & Country plaza. It is spacious inside but there aren’t any tables or chairs so it isn’t a place to hang out. Ordered my favorite strawberry matcha latte with oat milk and it was on point! So glad they opened one up closer to the South Bay!  Will definitely make the drive for this!
pos	Boba Guys is known to be one of the best boba places in the Bay, it's always been the hype and will keep it's reputation at the top. I've been to their SF locations but I remember that they had mostly milk based drinks to choose from and I usually don't drink milk based drinks.  When I came here in the afternoon, it was pretty busy! The line was out the door passing the neighboring businesses; although I only waited around 20 mins to order. I ordered the Strawberry matcha latte and their new seasonal drink POG. POG was pretty refreshing, trying to replicate the hawaiian pog drink. And their signature strawberry matcha latte has always been one of their most popular drinks! It's always good and sweet, never disappointing and very consistent.  Their customer service was great! Answering to questions and preferences, even offering their bakery selection. I was tempted to get something since it's from Third Culture, but I just felt like it was too pricey for the size of it...! But people have said it's really worth trying and getting. Maybe I'll get it next time when I'm in the area!
pos	Boba Guys never disappoints. 👍🏻👍🏻  Korean Banana Milk w/espresso was good. Strawberry Fresca is always a great pick too! Black sesame, horchata, damn. Everything's good.
neg	Boba Guys union busts employees. Shame on them.
pos	This place offers a lot of varieties of boba milk. The boba itself are fresh made by the shop, so it taste amazing. You can also pick milk, they have amazing oat milk! You should try!  I ordered strawberry matcha with oat milk and black sesame latte! Both are tastes so good! But my favorite goes to the black sesame latte😍 you can taste a strong taste of sesame!!  PS: They use bamboo straws to keep the environment sustain and the quality is really good too!
pos	Good quality matcha! Caramel matcha latte (pandan infused caramel) is their best drink (it's seasonal, sadly), IMHO. Jasmine green milk tea and Thai milk tea are also good. I'm not a fan of the Muscat oolong because I prefer darker oolong tea that tastes more like a black tea (theirs is fruity and light), but it depends on your preference. The biggest draw to Boba Guys is that they use better quality ingredients than most boba places, which is a worthwhile consideration for those who consume more boba milk tea than they maybe should! (Is there such a thing? :)
neu	This isn't my first time at Boba Guys and I sought out this location because of my previous experiences and drinks. Today was meh. I ordered the ube halaya drink with boba and a Thai tea with boba. The boba always tastes so fresh but I didn't particularly like the ube halaya. It didn't have a strong ube or coconut water taste and it had a grainy texture. The Thai tea boba drink was standard. With so many boba places in the Bay Area, I'm going to venture out to try others.
pos	It's a small Boba guys and brand new. The line is long but worth it for Boba guys 💕
pos	Hits differently than most boba spots. Always a line on weekends, so be prepared for that. Usually half an hour to an hour wait time, I recommend going on a weekday where they are less busy. Great selections, and great quality ingredients. Best boba I've had in the Bay Area!
pos	Good matcha latte, wish they have more customization (more no sugar signature drinks please!)
neg	Plzplz bring the preorder system back!!! Especially during pandemic! It's such a time saving and safe way to buy your boba drinks!
neg	They used to have a great pre-order system online but now this store is no longer available. Only through DoorDash. Disappointed. Also they close too early so I can’t get it after work.
neu	Boba guys always seems hit or miss, I do love their dirty horchata drink, but recently tried the Mango Sticky Rice Drink and could not stomach it and had to just toss it out, and it certainly wasn't cheap- do not recommend that one.
pos	Great boba drinks even when served the wrong one was still very good.
pos	The boba has a unique taste, very fresh and crafted tea spot. Would come back for their mango sticky rice drink 🧋
pos	So glad they are finally here! Their boba is the best, not overcooked, not undercooked, not hard, not too soft that it sticks - it's perfect! They have the best ingredients (actual tea leaves and homemade grass jelly for example) and the highest quality of everything! Plus they have nice milk options and coffee beans from Andytown. Love, love, love them!
pos	Ordered a large number of drinks for an event in advance. When picking up, one of the bags tore open and four drinks ended up on the ground. The staff cleaned up the mess and replaced the drinks quickly. Thanks for saving the day!
pos	Best milk tea in town !
pos	One of its kind in vareity of teas I loved the preparation and the ambience
pos	Long line, but got my strawberry matcha latte pretty quickly. The staff is super friendly and recommended good drinks
pos	I guess it was inevitable that Boba Guys would make its way to Palo Alto. With all of the neighboring startups, as well as a high school and university across the street, I'm honestly kind of surprised that it took this long. Nonetheless, the standard for high quality boba has finally arrived, and boy is it popular.  Palo Alto isn't void of boba shops. There are spots downtown, as well as midtown, but they're not quite the same as Boba Guys. From the organic ingredients, to their homemade boba, Boba Guys has really taken the extra step to differentiate themselves from the competition. Although it does reflect accordingly with its pricing, it's not priced to the level in which it'd deter customers.  Prior to coming here, you should know that you're going to allocate a good 20-30 minutes of commitment. Hence, you'll really want your boba. As expected with it's location, there's always a line at Boba Guys, and since many of it's drinks are made to order, coupled with just one cashier, be prepared to wait. Perhaps during your wait, you'll be enticed with some Boba Guys merchandise. Who knows?  With all that hype, the drinks have to taste good right? Perhaps it is a bit because of hype, but I fancy myself a nice cup from Boba Guys over its competition. The ingredients are fresh, and the boba has a nice sweetness and chew to it. In it's conquest for world boba domination, Boba Guys has conquered yet another city.
pos	Dirty horchata was pretty yummy. For the price it’s good , but I would like it to be a bit more creamy. Service was fast and the mobile order worked great.
pos	Seems like a really popular place, lots of people. Workers are really friendly.
pos	The best part of boba guys is all of their amazing drinks! The worst part of boba guys is that everyone else knows, too. Be prepared to wait in line to order, but service is friendly and quick after that!
pos	So happy there is a boba guys in Palo Alto now!  I had the Strawberry Tea Fresca and it was fruity, but not too sweet - perfect for me! The boba was the best I've had in the bay area! Very chewy, slightly sticky, and with a hint of honey!
pos	Friendly staff. If there is a short line, take advantage and jump in. The line can get very long particularly with kids from Paly across the street. All time gave boba drink - strawberry matcha latte with boba and chia seeds. You can also select almond, oat, or regular milk.
pos	My personal favorite boba store. The covid measures currently seem quite safe, and the boba is as good as ever. I highly recommend the matcha latte with tapioca.
neu	The quality of the boba is decent, but the pricing seems somewhat absurd to me. I could find the same quality boba in different locations, for cheaper. However, I still enjoyed my experience and see why people flock here.
neg	Waited for over 30min for a HK style, turns out their HK style tastes just like cans sold in the supermarket. Boba lovers, just drive 10min more to their San Carlos location, much less wait and better tastes.
pos	My go-to boba place. Delicious!! Their popularity attracts so many (so be prepared for long lines), but the staff remain very friendly while also being extremely efficient. See you guys again soon!
neu	Good Boba, but the wait has been outrageous every time I've been there on a weekend.  Epitomizes everything wrong with the Silicon Valley: people standing in a line out the door to get white-washed Asian cuisine so that they can post a picture of it on Instagram.
neg	The line is always very long and many of the drinks require very specific tastes. It's quite pricy as well, and personally, I've found better boba places around the same area.
pos	Hot Black Sugar Hojicha with Oat Milk (less sweet) is surprisingly good! The Strawberry Matcha Latte with Oat Milk is pretty good too, just on the sweeter side.
pos	Got the matcha boba tea and loved it.
neu	I went there to grab a quick boba due to the heat in the city. The line was pretty long. Their staff and service are very friendly. But I think that the drink is a little watery.
pos	Lines are always kind of long. But the staff is friendly, and I've always enjoyed their Strawberry Rice Milk drink.
neg	Very awful service. I checked in with the cashier if they had any metal straws left, and they said they did, so I reserved one in advance before getting in line since the line was very long. After waiting for 30 minutes in 80 degree weather, I saw her give away the last two metal straws to the customer before me. The cashier even recognized me as the girl who had the straw set aside earlier. I don’t understand why they would just do that to a customer who waited in line for such a long time.
pos	the only good boba store, always a wait but worth it
pos	This place has amazing tea. However be expected to wait in line due to it being so popular.  They make their tea fresh and it's loose leaf. If you love tea I highly recommend this place.
pos	The boba is delicious, but they don’t have it ready at 10AM when they open, only an hour later at 11AM... it’s a boba place, it should be ready when they open, otherwise great stuff. Love the horchata
pos	Boba Guys never fails, excellent quality, quick service. Used door dash to avoid the line and worked great!
pos	The tea is good as ever. I like their push to be more environmentally sustainable. I just take off the star because I know there was stay stuff going on with the company recently.
pos	Delicious! I got the Korean banana milk with boba. It was a great mix of a creamy taste from the oat milk with a hint of banana.
pos	Drinks are good.  Service was decent.
pos	Omgosh the lavender milk tea is outrageously good. And I like that they offer dairy alternative - I got the oak milk and it was delicious. Worth the wait!
pos	The boba taste is bad and i don't intend to go back but on the whole it's a cool, hopping place to be.
pos	Really dig their drinks! I'm glad they opened a store closer to where I live. Only downsides are the long lines(Bc they are popular/might need to hire more people) and there aren't really places to sit.
pos	I usually drive from Milpitas to get here. This review is for those in the COVID period for January 2021. I would highly reccommend ordering online before going, it beats the wait.
pos	Fabulous products. Just wish they get with the program and provide the ability to order on line. It will greatly reduce the, at times, awful wait times to place my fav tea order and probably grow client base and revenue!
neu	They didn't mention my name because was too long I guess. Other wise is a good place and any other boba guys location.
neg	Ordered online, saw my drink was ready at the window but still had to wait in line for 10 minutes. No sense. VERY BAD customer service by blond girl handing our drinks
neg	Waited for too long time. Ordered decaf black milk tea buy it's totally diluted. The taste was so bad. Don't recommend.
pos	They gave me a free replacement drink with double topping after a miss communication in my original order.  Love the boba tea, great atmosphere.
pos	This is one of the best Bubble teas I've ever had. I tried their Ube Halaya after waiting in line for about 20-25 minutes. It was worth the wait.
pos	Amazing - best boba guys location
neu	The almond jelly toppings kinda spoiled my hong kong classic tea. They should provide recommendation on toppings which taste the best for a certain drink.
neg	Wait time was over 40 minutes over expected delivery time.
neg	The tea is watery and it has very little taste of tea. Boba is chewy. Comparing to tea leaf, ten ren or Starbucks  Not worth the hype and the wait.
neu	Boba is good (if they havent run out). I love the ube latte. Plenty people like this place.
pos	Liked the taste. But price is on the higher end.
neg	I understand that they aren't doing adjustments but it'd be nice to have options for people who can't have too much sugar (I usually have drinks at 0% but even drinks at 25% would've been nice and a more viable option)
pos	Good but VERY busy on the weekend. 20 minute wait after ordering. I recommend ordering online before you arrive.
pos	Delicious and sweet black balls in milk tea 🤤 made my toes curl (photo for proof)
pos	We have a abstractionism artist here. Make my day thanks;D
pos	I'm not giving it 5 stars because the place is very good, but not out of this world to justify crazy lines any time I'm in the area. You can get similar goodies elsewhere without waiting in line over 30 minutes.
pos	Super good! We will be back next week. Ordered ahead online, such a nice feature
pos	They now only took online order. However, the line is still crazy in COVID weekdays.  Recommend to pre-order before going. Could save you 10 mins.
pos	Busy busy!
neu	Not a comment on their drinks, but they do need to improve their throughout. Having to wait 25 minutes for a drink is excessive.
pos	Friend loves this place. He referred me and I must say he was right. Absolutely amazing.  If you like boba this is your stop.
neg	Ordered a 64oz Classic Black 20 hours ahead online. Was told they ran out of stock when pickup.  VERY frustrating.
pos	Good service; they have streamlined ordering outside for a quick, safe experience. Good drinks
pos	The cashier was very nice and helped me out appropriately! Thanks. I had the coffee milk tea and it was just as I asked. I will be sure to come back often
pos	Always reliable for perfectly prepared boba drinks. Matcha anything is my personal favorite here.
pos	Only rating the drink (not the wait time or service). Thai Tea is the bees knees.
pos	Very popular place for milk tea. They use all organic and housemade ingredients. Tastes good.
pos	Tasty tea and fast service regardless of method of ordering (pickup in doordash/related app or in store walk-up)
pos	Worth the line?  Maybe!  It's very good.  Tapioca is so fresh and oat milk makes everything better.
pos	I got a soda from here. 15 minute wait when busiest, but great quality and convenience.
pos	Looks really good, but for me, it is a little bit sweet that I thought
neu	It is ok, the boba doesn't stands out. Would not go out of my way to get it
pos	It was okay. Quite a lot of people waiting for their order so you might want to wait on your car or pick up at an off peak time
pos	Not a big fan of their milk tea but the strawberry match latte is great.
neu	Decent but not the same as New York
pos	Loved the coffee drink I got! I think it was the horchata with espresso- so delicious!
pos	The boba was AMAZING but they need to make it more clear on how to order
pos	Super friendly and helpful. Line during busy after school hours. Inside the town and country plaza so parking is terrible
pos	Good place to share ice cream or a non-dairy variety is also available!
neg	Staff wasn’t the nicest, but the boba is decent.
pos	Drinks were yummy, service was kinda slow.
neu	The site is super understaffed for the past few months , especially during peak time , say Friday afternoon.
pos	Banana milk is the best thing ever! Be prepared for a long line if you go here.
pos	Great value for premium ingredients - most other places use cheap non-dairy creamer powder (while tasty, probably not great for you).
pos	ITS SO GOOD!!!! my favorite is the caramel matcha latte with boba.
neg	No boba at boba guys
pos	All I can say is BEST. But you pay for it, not cheap.
pos	Good but like other places better for the matcha
pos	It's good to see this place experimenting with new flavors. Great taste!
neg	Don't believe the hype. Been in line for hours, days, at this point. I've lost all concept of time. Send. Help. Please.
pos	The wait is often extreme but the boba is great
pos	“Not too busy” apparently means a 40 minute wait. Thanks, Google® algorithms.
pos	Why wouldn't you end your week and start your weekend on an ultra positive note by dropping by the Boba Guys?
pos	I sincerely recommend the strawberry rice milk. Absolutely Amazing!!!
pos	great boba, but be prepared to wait upwards of half an hour

neu	Wasn't there?
pos	YUM

neg	Better places anywhere in San Carlos and redwood
neu	Fortunately, there is nothing special about drinking it. Not so good to buy a team worth more than 5 minutes to buy 
neg	I bought it in advance with To Go, but there was no straw when I got in the car. go back and take eight 
pos	Wao yummy, not very sweet, very good attention
